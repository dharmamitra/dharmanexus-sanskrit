['SA_T11_ratksanu-14']	akṣaṇike dharmiṇi kramākramasadbhāvāyogāt /	akṣaṇike dharmiṇi kramākrama sadbhāva ayogāt 	Because the existence of sequence and simultaneity is not possible in the non-momentary subject.
['SA_T11_ratksanu-15']	tathā hi prāptāparakālayor ekatve nityatvam /	tathā hi prāpta apara kālayoḥ eka tve nitya tvam 	For thus, if there is identity of the present and the subsequent moments, [the object] is eternal.

['SA_T11_ratksanu-25']	anayoś ca parasparaparihārasthitilakṣaṇo virodhaḥ /	anayoḥ ca paraspara parihāra sthiti lakṣaṇaḥ virodhaḥ 	And this contradiction is characterized by the mutual exclusion of the two.

['SA_T11_ratksanu-27']	kramākramayogitvākṣaṇikatvayor virodhād eva /	             	Because of the contradiction between having a sequential or non-sequential nature and being momentary.

['SA_T11_ratksanu-29']	sapakṣe bhāvāt /	sapakṣe bhāvāt 	Because it exists in similar instances.

Therefore it is not inconclusive. Thus it is faultless.
['SA_T11_ratksanu-37']	vyāpakānupalambhaḥ /	vyāpaka anupalambhaḥ 	Non-apprehension of the pervasion.

['SA_T11_ratksanu-40']	asyāpy anekadoṣaduṣṭatvāt /	asya api aneka doṣa duṣṭa tvāt 	Because this [reasoning] is also flawed by many faults.
['SA_T11_ratksanu-41']	tathā hi na tāvad ayaṃ prasaṅga hetuḥ /	tathā hi na tāvat ayam prasaṅga hetuḥ 	To begin with, this is not a reductio ad absurdum argument.

['SA_T11_ratksanu-44']	viparyayaparyavasānābhāvāc ca /	viparyaya paryavasāna abhāvāt ca 	And because there is no pervasion by the contradictory.

['SA_T11_ratksanu-46']	tadāśrayāsiddhaḥ /	tad āśraya asiddhaḥ 	then it is unestablished as a basis.
['SA_T11_ratksanu-47']	akṣaṇikasyāśrayasyāsambhavāt /	akṣaṇikasya āśrayasya asambhavāt 	Because a non-momentary basis is impossible.
['SA_T11_ratksanu-48']	apratītatvād vā /	a pratīta tvāt vā 	Or because it is not known.
['SA_T11_ratksanu-49']	pratītir hi pratyakṣeṇānumānena vikalpamātreṇa vā syāt /	pratītiḥ hi pratyakṣeṇa anumānena vikalpa mātreṇa vā syāt 	For knowledge may be by perception, inference, or mere conceptualization.

['SA_T11_ratksanu-51']	arthakriyākāritve kramākramayor anyatarasyāvaśyambhāvāt /	arthakriyā kāri tve krama akramayoḥ anyatarasya avaśyambhāvāt 	Because if it has the nature of causal efficiency, then either succession or simultaneity is necessarily present.
['SA_T11_ratksanu-52']	antimapakṣe tu na kaścid dhetur anāśrayaḥ syāt /	antima pakṣe tu na kaścid hetuḥ anāśrayaḥ syāt 	But in the last case, no reason would be without a basis,
['SA_T11_ratksanu-53']	vikalpamātrasiddhasya dharmiṇaḥ sarvatra sulabhatvāt /	vikalpa mātra siddhasya dharmiṇaḥ sarvatra sulabha tvāt 	because a subject established by mere imagination is easy to find everywhere.

['SA_T11_ratksanu-60']	kathaṃ bādhakāvatāraḥ /	katham bādhaka avatāraḥ 	How can there be an occasion for a refutation?
['SA_T11_ratksanu-61']	tṛītye tu na sarvadā 'kṣaṇikasattāniṣedhaḥ /	  tu na         	But in the third case, the denial of the existence of the non-momentary is not always the case,
['SA_T11_ratksanu-62']	tadarpitasaṃskārābhāve tat smaraṇāyogāt /	tad arpita saṃskāra abhāve tat smaraṇa ayogāt 	because if there is an absence of the trace impression deposited by that [conceptual cognition], it is impossible to remember it.
['SA_T11_ratksanu-63']	caturthe tu sandigdhāśrayatvaṃ hetudoṣaḥ /	           	But in the fourth case, the reason has the fault of having a doubtful basis.

Thus, the non-establishment of the basis is indeed raised.
['SA_T11_ratksanu-66']	evaṃ dṛṣṭānto 'pi pratihantavyaḥ /	evam pratihantavyaḥ 	In the same way, the example should be refuted.

['SA_T11_ratksanu-96']	sahakārisahitād eva tataḥ kāryotpattidarśanāt /	sahakāri sahitāt eva tatas kārya utpatti darśanāt 	Because the effect is seen to arise only from it in conjunction with auxiliaries.
