['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-2']	atha śabdo nirūpyate /	atha śabdaḥ nirūpyate 	Now, words are being examined.
['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-3']	prayogahetubhūtārthatattvajñānajanyaḥ śabdaḥ pramāṇam /	                   	A word that arises from the true knowledge of the object that is the reason for the application is a means of valid knowledge.

['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-6']	na ca śabdo na pramāṇamiti vākyasya prāmāṇyāpramāṇyayorvyāghātaḥ /	na ca śabdaḥ na pramāṇam iti vākyasya prāmāṇya apramāṇyayoḥ vyāghātaḥ 	And there is no contradiction between the reliability and unreliability of the sentence The word is not a means of valid knowledge.

['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-9']	tathāpi śabdo na pramāṇāntaraṃ padārthasaṃsargasyānumānādeva siddheḥ /	tathā api śabdaḥ na pramāṇa antaram padārtha saṃsargasya anumānāt eva siddheḥ 	Even so, a word is not a separate means of valid knowledge, because the connection of the meanings of words is established by inference alone.

['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-17']	yattu smāritārthasaṃsargavantoti sādhyaṃ /	yat tu smārita artha saṃsargavanti iti sādhyam 	But the probandum is because they have the relation of the remembered meanings.
['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-18']	matvarthaśca liṅgatayā jñāpakatvaṃ /	matu arthaḥ ca liṅgatayā jñāpaka tvam 	And the suffix 'matup' indicates the nature of being a means of knowledge.
['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-19']	na cānyonyāśrayaḥ /	na ca anyonya āśrayaḥ 	And there is no mutual dependence.
['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-20']	pūrvapūrvānumitihetutvena anāditvāt /	              	Because it is beginningless, being the cause of the prior inferential knowledge.

['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-23']	pramāpakatve tenaiva vyabhicārāt /	pramāpaka tve tena eva vyabhicārāt 	Because there is deviation even by being a means of valid knowledge.
['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-24']	jñānāvacchedakatayā ca saṃsargasiddhiḥ jñānajñānasya tadviṣayaviṣayakatvaniyamāt /	                                              	And the establishment of the relation is by being the qualifier of the cognition, because the knowledge of knowledge is invariably about its object.
['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-25']	Bibl / Ind / / IV / / p / 	bibl ind 	Bibl. Ind. IV. p.
['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-26']	saṃsarge ca sambandhina eva viśeṣakatvāt /	saṃsarge ca sambandhinaḥ eva viśeṣaka tvāt 	And in the case of relation, only the related object is the qualifier.

['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-28']	athaivaṃ bhrāntijñānamapi bhramaḥ syāt /	athā evam bhrānti jñānam api bhramaḥ syāt 	Now, if it is so, even erroneous knowledge would be an error.

Rather, it is because of being about a property in a different substratum.
['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-35']	na ca bhramasya jñāne vyadhikaraṇaṃ prakāraḥ /	na ca bhramasya jñāne vyadhikaraṇam prakāraḥ 	And in a mistake, there is no property in a different substratum in the cognition.

['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-38']	na ca saṃsargamapratītya vākyaracanā na sambhavatītyāhāryyaṃ tasya saṃsargajñānaṃ sambhavatīti vācyam /	na ca saṃsargam a pratītya vākya racanā na sambhavati iti āhāryyam tasya saṃsarga jñānam sambhavati iti vācyam 	And it cannot be said that the knowledge of the relation is not possible without the knowledge of the relation, and that it is possible as an impression from that.
['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-39']	tāvatpadajñānādeva ekasyeva vākyaracanopapatteḥ /	tāvat pada jñānāt eva ekasya iva vākya racanā upapatteḥ 	Because the construction of a sentence is possible even for one person from the knowledge of just those words.
['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-40']	anyaccāpi tasyaiva tantratvāditi cet / na /	anyat ca api tasya eva tantra tvāt iti ced na 	And because of the dependence of that very thing on another, if it is said that there is inconstancy in the statement of a property, it is not so.

['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-42']	ata eva visambādivākye ekavaduccarite na vyabhicāraḥ /	atas eva visamba ādi vākye eka vat uccarite na vyabhicāraḥ 	For this very reason, there is no inconstancy in the statement of a sentence uttered by one person, such as 'vīsāṇam' etc.
['SA_GSP29_gangtciu-43']	śabdāt saṃsargapratyayastu yogyatābhramāt /	śabdāt saṃsarga pratyayaḥ tu yogya tā bhramāt 	But the cognition of relation from the word is due to the error of fitness.

And the intention is the state of being the object of the cognition of the particular relation of the meanings of the words.

Therefore, the knowledge of the relation of the words is preceded by that. Thus, the knowledge that impels is only from the word.
