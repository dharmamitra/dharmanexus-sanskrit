['SA_T11_sbpramvu-1']	daḥ ayaṃ ca vikalpabuddhyāropitatvād asamīkṣitatatvārthḥ /	R   ayam ca vikalpa buddhi āropita tvāt 	This is also not examined in terms of the truth, because it is superimposed by the conceptual cognition.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-2']	anapekṣitas tatvārtho vastvartho yeneti vigrahaḥ /	an apekṣitaḥ tatva arthaḥ vastu arthaḥ yena iti vigrahaḥ 	The analysis is: one who does not examine the truth, the meaning of reality, the meaning of things.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-3']	yathā loke buddhyārūḍho 'py adhyavasitatadbhāvatayā pratīyate /	yathā loke buddhi ārūḍhaḥ pi adhyavasita tad bhāva tayā pratīyate 	Just as in the world, even though superimposed by cognition, it is cognized as having that nature by firm conviction.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-4']	taṃ dharmādivibhāgaṃ tatheti lokapratītivat /	tam dharma ādi vibhāgam tathā iti loka pratīti vat 	That division of dharma, etc., is like that, according to popular cognition.

['SA_T11_sbpramvu-6']	kim arthaṃ para ///	kim artham para 	For what purpose? What else?
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-7']	ya / kiṃ punaḥ kāraṇam ekatvādivyavahārasya vastuny asaṃbhava ity ata āha /	    punar          iti atas āha 	What is the reason for the impossibility of the usage of oneness, etc. in reality? For this reason, he says:
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-8']	saṃsṛjyanta ityādi pāramārthikāḥ arthāḥ svato na saṃsṛyante tato na sāmānyavyavahāro vastuni /	saṃsṛjyante ityādi pāramārthikāḥ arthāḥ svatas na saṃsṛyante tatas na sāmānya vyavahāraḥ vastuni 	The ultimate objects do not really combine by themselves, therefore there is no usage of universals in reality.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-9']	na bhidyante kṛtakatvādibhir dharmaiḥ pratyekaṃ tasya vastuno 'nekatvāyogāt ataś ca teṣv artheṣu bahuṣu rūpam ekaṃ /	na bhidyante kṛtaka tva ādibhiḥ dharmaiḥ pratyekam tasya vastunaḥ neka tva ayogāt atas ca teṣu artheṣu bahuṣu rūpam ekam 	They are not differentiated by producedness, etc., because that one thing cannot be many individually, and therefore that one form is in many things.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-10']	ekasmin vārthe 'nekaṃ rūpaṃ yad adhyavasīyate tad buddher vika ///	ekasmin vā arthe na ekam rūpam yat adhyavasīyate tat buddheḥ 	The many forms that are firmly ascertained in one thing are superimposed by cognition on that one thing.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-11']	nte / na bhidyante pāramārthikā arthās tataḥ kāraṇāt /	  na bhidyante       	They are not different, because the ultimate objects are not different from that cause.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-12']	sāmānyam idaṃ bahūnāṃ /	sāmānyam idam bahūnām 	This is a generality of many.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-13']	tathā dharmāṇāṃ dharmiṇāṃ ca bheda ity api yo 'yaṃ bhedo nānātvavyavahāraḥ /	tathā dharmāṇām dharmiṇām ca bhedaḥ iti api yaḥ yam bhedaḥ nānātva vyavahāraḥ 	Similarly, this difference, this usage of diversity, is also the difference of dharmas and dharma-possessors.

['SA_T11_sbpramvu-15']	tasyaiva cetyādi /	tasya eva ca ityādi 	And that very [difference], etc.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-16']	buddhipratibhāsasyaiva etad uktaṃ bhavati bāhyenaikatvādhyavasāyā ///	buddhi pratibhāsasya eva etat uktam bhavati bāhyena eka tva adhyavasāyā 	This is said to be the superimposition of oneness with the external in the appearance of cognition only.

['SA_T11_sbpramvu-18']	ata evāha prakalpyata iti /	atas eva āha prakalpyate iti 	For this very reason, he says is imagined.

['SA_T11_sbpramvu-20']	ity āha sādhyetyādi /	iti āha sādhya ityādi 	He says the property to be proven, etc.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-21']	idaṃ sādhyam idaṃ sādhanam ity asmin saṃkalpe vastudarśanahānitaḥ kutaḥ sva ///	idam sādhyam idam sādhanam iti asmin saṃkalpe vastu darśana hānitaḥ kutas 	From the loss of the perception of an object in the conception this is the property to be proven, this is the means of proof, how can the own characteristic be grasped by that [conceptual cognition]?
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-22']	nyāpohaviśiṣṭo bhedo gṛhyata ity abhidhānād ācāryadiṅnāgaprabhṛtiḥ svalakṣaṇasya sāmānyasaṃsṛṣṭasya grahaṇaṃ /	                                                                        	Because it is stated that a difference qualified by the exclusion of other is grasped, the grasping of an individual characteristic mixed with a universal was asserted by the teacher Dignāga and others.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-23']	pratijñātam ity āśaṅkām apanayann āha bheda ityādi /	pratijñātam iti āśaṅkām apanayan āha bhedaḥ ityādi 	Removing doubt about what was asserted, he says difference and so on.

['SA_T11_sbpramvu-25']	ddhisanniceśina eva bhe ///	       	Indeed, only those that are in close proximity are distinguished...
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-26']	ṣṭā gṛhyanta iti tatrāpi boddhavyaṃ /	v gṛhyante iti tatra api boddhavyam 	even there, it should be understood.

['SA_T11_sbpramvu-29']	sāmānyasaṃsṛṣṭo grāhya ity atrāpi vacane na svalakṣaṇaṃ boddhavyaṃ iti /	sāmānya saṃsṛṣṭaḥ grāhyaḥ iti atra api vacane na sva lakṣaṇam boddhavyam iti 	There, this is the meaning: Even in the statement 'a difference mixed with a universal is to be grasped,' an individual characteristic should not be understood.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-30']	kiṃ punaḥ kāraṇaṃ tatraivaṃ boddhavyam iti ced āha samānetyādi /	kim punar kāraṇam tatra evam boddhavyam iti ced āha samāna ityādi 	If it is asked what is the reason for understanding it that way there, he says when there is sameness and so on.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-31']	anekasminn ekatvā ///	an ekasmin eka tvā 	In many, oneness...
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-32']	sminn upādhibahutvaṃ bhinnākāraḥ ādiśabdād dharmadharmyākāraparigrahaḥ /	                  	in one, the multiplicity of limiting adjuncts is the different form. The word and so on includes the forms of the property and the possessor of the property.

What is the reason? Because in that one specific characteristic, such as being produced or impermanent,
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-34']	bahubhedānān dharmāṇāṃ kiṃ viśiṣṭānāṃ bhedānāṃ vasturūpāṇāṃ tatraikasmin svalakṣaṇe 'yogāt /	dharmāṇām kim viśiṣṭānām bhedānām vastu rūpāṇām tatra ekasmin sva lakṣaṇe yogāt 	many different dharmas, or different entities in the form of distinctions, cannot be combined in that one specific characteristic.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-35']	na hy ekasmin vastuni vasturūpāṇi bahūni yujyante niraṃśatvāt svalakṣaṇa ///	na hi ekasmin vastuni vastu rūpāṇi bahūni yujyante niraṃśa tvāt 	For in one entity, many entities cannot be combined, because the specific characteristic is partless.

The context is that there is no conceptualization.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-37']	asādhāraṇena rūpeṇa svalakṣaṇasya grāhako vikalpāpi nāstīty arthaḥ /	asādhāraṇena rūpeṇa sva lakṣaṇasya grāhakaḥ na asti iti arthaḥ 	The meaning is that there is also no conceptualization that apprehends the specific characteristic by its uncommon form.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-38']	kiṃ kāraṇaṃ sāmānyenaiva śabdasya kalpanāyāś ca vṛttitaḥ tatpratipādikā na śrutir astīti bruvatā svalakṣaṇe ///	kim kāraṇam sāmānyena eva śabdasya kalpanāyāḥ ca vṛttitaḥ tad pratipādikā na śrutiḥ asti iti bruvatā sva lakṣaṇe 	What is the reason? Because the word and conceptualization operate only by way of the universal. By saying there is no word that expresses it, it is said that the specific characteristic is not the object of a word.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-39']	punar ityādi /	punar ityādi 	Again, etc.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-40']	na tu sāmānyenaiva vṛttita ity anantaram uktatvād ayuktaṃ codyaṃ /	na tu sāmānyena eva vṛttitaḥ iti anantaram ukta tvāt ayuktam codyam 	Because it was just said that it does not operate only by way of the universal, the objection is not appropriate.

Words are said to denote that which is not made the object of convention, but is indicated by convention for the purpose of usage. This is convention.
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-42']	yasmin svalakṣaṇe saṃketaḥ kriyata itīṣyate /	yasmin sva lakṣaṇe saṃketaḥ kriyate iti iṣyate 	That particular characteristic in which convention is supposed to be made,

When it is accepted that it is not different from the substratum, there is no inherence, because what is not different from one thing cannot be of the nature of that thing...

['SA_T11_sbpramvu-54']	apūrvāsv iti /	apūrvāsu iti 	If, because of the lack of relation of a separate universal, it does not generate cognition of its own form in another individual, then it is the same in the first individual as well. So why is it said that it is in previously unseen individuals?
['SA_T11_sbpramvu-55']	vyaktiṣv ity eva vaktavyaṃ /	vyaktiṣu iti eva vaktavyam 	It should be said simply that it is in individuals.

['SA_T11_sbpramvu-60']	tato 'nyatvād ity arthaḥ /	tatas nya tvāt iti arthaḥ 	The meaning is: because of being other than that.

['SA_T11_sbpramvu-62']	d / vānyatvalakṣaṇam ity arthaḥ /	          	The meaning is: because otherness is the characteristic.

['SA_T11_sbpramvu-64']	ṣaṣṭhyarthe vatiḥ /	ṣaṣṭhī arthe vatiḥ 	The suffix vati is in the sense of the sixth case.

To this extent, the pervasion by the characteristic of otherness of that nature is stated.
