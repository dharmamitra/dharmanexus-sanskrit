We say it is inferred from the scriptures of the learned. At the beginning of the treatise,
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-31']	sambhavaḥ / tenāsya taddhetutvam taccāgamādevāvagamyate / anyasya	sambhavaḥ tena asya tad hetu tvam tat ca āgamāt eva avagamyate anyasya 	the praise, salutation etc. of the desired deity that is done by the learned is not possible without being the cause of the desired completion etc. Therefore, it is the cause of that, and that is understood only from the scriptures. For another,
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-32']	pramāṇasyātrāsambhavāt / tathā maṅgalācārayuktānāṃ vinipāto na vidyate iti smṛteśca	pramāṇasya atra asambhavāt tathā maṅgala ācāra yuktānām vinipātaḥ na vidyate iti smṛteḥ ca 	Because a means of valid knowledge is not possible here, and also because of the Smṛti text: For those who are engaged in auspicious conduct, there is no downfall.
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-33']	tadavagamaḥ / tathā parisamāpteḥ kādācitkatayā kāraṇāpekṣā /	tad avagamaḥ tathā parisamāpteḥ kādācitkatayā kāraṇa apekṣā 	The understanding of that is thus. Similarly, since completion is occasional, it requires a cause.
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-34']	taccānyasyāsambhavānnamaskārādijanito dharmaviśeṣa iti kalpyate / kathaṃ tasya taddhetutvamiti	tat ca anyasya asambhavāt namaskāra ādi janitaḥ dharma viśeṣaḥ iti kalpyate katham tasya tad hetu tvam iti 	And that is imagined to be a special dharma generated by bowing down, etc., because of the impossibility of anything else. If it is asked how that is the cause of that,
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-35', 'MBtattvaprakasaHK-36']	cet / ucyate namaskārādiḥ kāyiko vāciko mānaso vā dharmaviśeṣaṃ sampādayan🔽vighnahetubhūtamadharmaṃ paryasya parisamāptyādihetutāmadhigacchati / tasyeṣṭatvādiṣṭa 	ced ucyate namaskāra ādiḥ kāyikaḥ vācikaḥ mānasaḥ vā dharma viśeṣam sampādayan  vighna hetu bhūtam adharmam paryasya parisamāpti ādi hetutām adhigacchati tasya iṣṭa tvāt iṣṭa 	it is said: Bowing down, etc., whether bodily, verbal, or mental, accomplishing a special dharma,
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-37']	hetutvācca dharmasyeti / kathaṃ tarhi kvacit kṛte namaskāre parisamāptyabhāva iti cet /	hetu tvāt ca dharmasya iti katham tarhi kvacid kṛte namaskāre parisamāpti abhāvaḥ iti ced 	displacing the adharma that is the cause of obstacles, attains the status of being the cause of completion, etc. Because that is desired and because dharma is the cause of the desired. If it is asked how then there is no completion in some cases where bowing down is done,
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-38']	tadvaiguṇyāditi brūmaḥ / yathā kārīryādau vṛṣṭyādisādhane'nuṣthite vṛṣṭyādyabhāvāt	tad vaiguṇyāt iti brūmaḥ yathā kārīrī ādau vṛṣṭi ādi sādhanena uṣthite vṛṣṭi ādi abhāvāt 	we say it is due to the deficiency of that. Just as when the performance of rain-producing rites, etc. is not done, and there is no rain,
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-39']	tadvaiguṇyakalpanā pratibandhakādharmaprācuryakalpanā vā / evamatrāpīti na virodhaḥ / kathaṃ	tad vaiguṇya kalpanā pratibandhaka adharma prācurya kalpanā vā evam atra api iti na virodhaḥ katham 	the deficiency of that is imagined, or the abundance of the obstructing adharma is imagined. So it is here also. There is no contradiction. If it is asked how,
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-40']	tarhi namaskārādyabhāve kvacit parisamāptiḥ / kāraṇābhāve kāryotpattyasambhavāditi cet /	tarhi namaskāra ādi abhāve kvacid parisamāptiḥ kāraṇa abhāve kārya utpatti asambhavāt iti ced 	Then, if there is no salutation etc. somewhere, it is completed. If it is argued that the effect cannot arise in the absence of the cause,
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-41', 'MBtattvaprakasaHK-42']	naivam / tatra vācikanamaskārābhāve'pi kāyikamānasāderanumeyatvāt / anyathā🔽parisamāpterasambhava iti / nanu tarhi sa evāstvatrāpi / kiṃ vācikena	na evam tatra vācika namaskāra abhāve pi kāyika mānasa ādeḥ anumeya tvāt anyathā  parisamāpteḥ asambhavaḥ iti nanu tarhi saḥ eva astu atra api kim vācikena 	it is not so. Even in the absence of verbal salutation, bodily and mental etc. are inferable. Otherwise,🔽completion is impossible. If it is argued that then let that alone be here also, what is the use of the verbal
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-43']	granthaprācuryasampādakeneti cet / naivam / vācike prayojanāntarasambhavena tadupādānāt /	grantha prācurya sampādakena iti ced nā evam vācike prayojana antara sambhavena tad upādānāt 	which accomplishes the abundance of the text? It is not so. Because it is adopted due to the possibility of another purpose in the verbal.
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-44']	tathā hi yastu vismṛtyeṣṭadevatāstutinamaskārādiṃ śravaṇe pravartate /	tathā hi yaḥ tu vismṛtya iṣṭadevatā stuti namaskāra ādim śravaṇe pravartate 	Thus, he who engages in listening after forgetting the praise, salutation etc. to the chosen deity,

Since another purpose is possible,
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-46']	tadupādānamiti na kaścid virodhaḥ /	tat upādānam iti na kaścid virodhaḥ 	it is adopted. Thus there is no contradiction.
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-47']	athapadārthaḥ cidghana iti caitanyaghanaḥ / caitanyasāraḥ / cinmātra iti yāvat / athaiṣa	atha padārthaḥ cidghanaḥ iti caitanya ghanaḥ caitanya sāraḥ cit mātraḥ iti yāvat atha eṣa 	Now, the meaning of the word is: citta-ghana means dense consciousness, essence of consciousness, nothing but pure consciousness. Now this
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-48']	eva paramānando'nantaro'pāro vijñānaghanaḥ ityādiśrūteḥ / ādyantarahitaṃ śuddhaṃ	eva parama ānandaḥ anantara upāraḥ vijñāna ghanaḥ ityādi śrūteḥ ādi anta rahitam śuddham 	is the highest bliss, without an inner boundary, an infinite mass of consciousness, etc., according to the Upanisadic text. Pure,🔽without beginning or end,

Thus,🔽the author of the aphorisms, Śiva, has described in the first aphorism
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-51']	prathamasūtreṇātmanaścaitanyarūpatvamupavarṇitamityupapannaṃ cidghana iti /	prathama sūtreṇa ātmanaḥ caitanya rūpa tvam upavarṇitam iti upapannam cidghane iti 	that the Self is of the nature of consciousness. Therefore, it is reasonable to say full of consciousness.
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-52']	eka iti / advitīya ityarthaḥ / ekamevādvitīyam // / ahamekaḥ	ekaḥ iti advitīyaḥ iti arthaḥ ekam eva advitīyam chā u aham ekaḥ 	One means without a second. The meaning is one without a second.
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-53']	prathamamāsaṃ vartāmi ca bhaviṣyāmi ca nānyaḥ kaścinmatto vyatiriktaḥ 	prathama māsam vartāmi ca bhaviṣyāmi ca na anyaḥ kaścid mattaḥ vyatiriktaḥ atha u 	I alone existed in the beginning, I exist now, and I will exist in the future. There is no one else apart from me.

In the chapter on Tryambaka, Rudra is one, he does not stand as a second.
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-56']	rudrāya namo'stu // ityādinā'dvitīyatvapratipādanādupapannaṃ	rudrāya namaḥ astu te ā ityādinā advitīya tva pratipādanāt upapannam 	And in the Nīlarudra Upaniṣad, All Rudra, to that Rudra, salutations. Thus, by teaching that he is without a second,
['MBtattvaprakasaHK-57']	śivādvitīyatvamiti / na ca pratyakṣādipramāṇairanekārthāvabhāsādanupapannaṃ	śiva advitīya tvam iti na ca pratyakṣa ādi pramāṇaiḥ aneka artha avabhāsāt anupapannam 	it is reasonable to say that he is without a second.
