['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-3']	vitatas tantrāloko vigāhituṃ naiva śakyate sarvaiḥ /	vitataḥ tantrālokaḥ vigāhitum nā eva śakyate sarvaiḥ 	The extensive Tantra-loka cannot be fully comprehended by all.

And ignorance is of two kinds: mental and personal. Among them, the mental is of the nature of indecision
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-8']	viparītaniścayātmakaṃ ca /	viparīta niścaya ātmakam ca 	and of the nature of erroneous certainty.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-9']	pauruṣaṃ tu vikalpasvabhāvaṃ saṃkucitaprathātmakaṃ tad eva ca mūlakāraṇaṃ saṃsārasya iti vakṣyāmo malanirṇaye /	pauruṣam tu vikalpa svabhāvam saṃkucita prathā ātmakam tat eva ca mūla kāraṇam saṃsārasya iti vakṣyāmaḥ mala nirṇaye 	But we will explain in the section on impurity that the individual soul's ignorance, which is of the nature of doubt, and which is the contracted manifestation of consciousness, is itself the root cause of worldly existence.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-10']	tatra pauruṣam ajñānaṃ dīkṣādinā nivartetāpi kiṃ tu dīkṣāpi buddhigate anadhyavasāyātmake	tatra pauruṣam ajñānam dīkṣā ādinā nivarteta api kim tu dīkṣā api buddhi gate anadhyavasāya ātmake 	There, the individual soul's ignorance can be removed by initiation and other means, but initiation itself is not possible when there is ignorance in the form of indecision in the intellect.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-11']	ajñāne sati na sambhavati heyopādeyaniścayapūrvakatvāt tattvaśuddhiśivayojanārūpāyā dīkṣāyā iti /	ajñāne sati na sambhavati heya upādeya niścaya pūrvaka tvāt tattva śuddhi śiva yojanā rūpāyāḥ dīkṣāyāḥ iti 	This is because initiation, which consists of purifying the principles and uniting with Śiva, must be preceded by the determination of what is to be rejected and accepted.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-12']	tatra adhyavasāyātmakaṃ buddhiniṣṭham eva jñānaṃ pradhānam tad eva ca abhyasyamānaṃ pauruṣam api ajñānaṃ nihanti vikalpasaṃvidabhyāsasya avikalpāntatāparyavasānāt	tatra adhyavasāya ātmakam buddhi niṣṭham eva jñānam pradhānam tat eva ca abhyasyamānam pauruṣam api ajñānam nihanti vikalpa saṃvid abhyāsasya a vikalpa anta tā paryavasānāt 	There, knowledge that is based in the intellect and consists of determination is primary. And that alone, when practiced, destroys the individual soul's ignorance, because the practice of knowledge that is of the nature of doubt necessarily ends in non-dual knowledge.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-13']	vikalpāsaṃkucitasaṃvitprakāśarūpo hy ātmā śivasvabhāva iti sarvathā samastavastuniṣṭhaṃ samyaṅniścayātmakaṃ jñānam upādeyam /	vikalpa asaṃkucita saṃvid prakāśa rūpaḥ hi ātmā śiva svabhāvaḥ iti sarvathā samasta vastu niṣṭham samyak niścaya ātmakam jñānam upādeyam 	For the Self, which is of the nature of Śiva, is the light of consciousness that is not contracted by doubt. Therefore, knowledge that consists of perfect determination and is focused on all things in every way is to be accepted.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-14']	tac ca śāstrapūrvakam /	tat ca śāstra pūrvakam 	And that is preceded by scripture.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-15']	śāstraṃ ca parameśvarabhāṣitam eva pramāṇam /	śāstram ca parameśvara bhāṣitam eva pramāṇam 	And scripture is authoritative only when spoken by the Supreme Lord.

But the scripture of the Supreme Lord, which is of five streams, divided into ten, eighteen, eight, and so on,
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-19']	tato 'pi sarvasmāt sāraṃ ṣaḍardhaśāstrāṇi /	sarvasmāt sāram ṣaṣ ardha śāstrāṇi 	is a liberator from everything. Even from that, the essence of everything is the six and a half scriptures.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-20']	tebhyo 'pi mālinīvijayam /	tebhyaḥ pi mālinīvijayam 	Even from those, the Mālinīvijaya is the most important.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-21']	tadantargataś cārthaḥ saṃkalayyāśakyo nirūpayitum /	tad antargataḥ ca arthaḥ saṃkalayya aśakyaḥ nirūpayitum 	And the meaning contained within it, when collected, is impossible to define.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-22']	na ca anirūpitavastutattvasya muktatvaṃ mocakatvaṃ vā śuddhasya jñānasyaiva tathārūpatvāt iti /	na ca anirūpita vastu tattvasya mukta tvam mocaka tvam vā śuddhasya jñānasya eva tathārūpa tvāt iti 	And for one who has not defined the truth of reality, there is no liberation or ability to liberate, because pure knowledge alone has that form.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-23']	svabhyastajñānamūlatvāt parapuruṣārthasya tatsiddhaye idam ārabhyate /	su abhyasta jñāna mūla tvāt para puruṣa arthasya tad siddhaye idam ārabhyate 	Since the highest human goal has the root of self-cultivated knowledge, this is begun for its attainment.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-24']	ajñānaṃ kila bandhahetur uditaḥ śāstre malaṃ tat smṛtaṃ pūrṇajñānakalodaye tad akhilaṃ nirmūlatāṃ gacchati /	ajñānam kila bandha hetuḥ uditaḥ śāstre malam tat smṛtam pūrṇa jñāna kalā udaye tat akhilam nirmūla tām gacchati 	Ignorance is indeed said to be the cause of bondage in the scriptures, it is remembered as the impurity. When the full knowledge-power arises, all of that goes to the root.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-25', 'SA_GSP30_abhtantu-26']	dhvastāśeṣamalātmasaṃvidudaye mokṣaś ca tenāmunā śāstreṇa prakaṭīkaromi nikhilaṃ yaj jñeyatattvaṃ bhavet // /🔽tatra iha svabhāva eva paramopādeyaḥ sa ca sarvabhāvānāṃ prakāśarūpa eva aprakāśasya	dhvasta aśeṣa mala ātma saṃvid udaye mokṣaḥ ca tena amunā śāstreṇa prakaṭīkaromi nikhilam yat jñeya tattvam bhavet  tatra iha svabhāvaḥ eva parama upādeyaḥ sa ca sarva bhāvānām prakāśa rūpaḥ eva aprakāśasya 	The liberation is by the rise of the self-consciousness which is free from all impurities. By that scripture, I shall reveal the entire truth which is to be known.🔽There, here, the nature itself is the highest thing to be accepted, and that is the luminous form of all things, because the nature of the non-luminous

And that is not manifold, because the light cannot be penetrated by the nature of something else, and there is no difference in nature.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-28']	deśakālāv api ca asya na bhedakau tayor api tatprakāśasvabhāvatvāt iti eka eva prakāśaḥ	deśa kālau api ca asya na bhedakau tayoḥ api tad prakāśa svabhāva tvāt iti ekaḥ eva prakāśaḥ 	And space and time are also not different for it, because they also have the nature of illuminating that. Thus, there is only one light.

This is indeed undisputed by all here.🔽And that light is not dependent on another, for dependence itself is the state of being illuminated, and the state of being illuminated is itself dependent on another light.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-31']	na ca prakāśāntaraṃ kiṃcit asti iti svatantra ekaḥ prakāśaḥ svātantryād eva ca deśakālākārāvacchedavirahāt	na ca prakāśa antaram kiṃcid asti iti svatantraḥ ekaḥ prakāśaḥ svātantryāt eva ca deśa kāla ākāra avaccheda virahāt 	And there is no other light at all. Thus, there is only one independent light. And due to independence itself, there is absence of restriction by space, time, and form.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-32']	vyāpako nityaḥ sarvākāranirākārasvabhāvaḥ tasya ca svātantryam ānandaśaktiḥ taccamatkāra	vyāpakaḥ nityaḥ sarva ākāra nirākāra svabhāvaḥ tasya ca svātantryam ānanda śaktiḥ tad camatkāra 	He is all-pervading, eternal, of the nature of all forms and formless. And His independence is the power of bliss. That wonder

The form of light is the power of consciousness. The nature of reflection is the power of knowledge. The possession of all forms
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-34']	kriyāśaktiḥ ity evaṃ mukhyābhiḥ śaktibhiḥ yukto 'pi vastuta icchājñānakriyāśaktiyuktaḥ	kriyāśaktiḥ iti evam mukhyābhiḥ śaktibhiḥ vastutas icchā jñāna kriyāśakti yuktaḥ 	is the power of action. Thus, although endowed with the principal powers, in reality He is endowed with the powers of will, knowledge, and action.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-35']	anavacchinnaḥ prakāśo nijānandaviśrāntaḥ śivarūpaḥ sa eva svātantryāt ātmānaṃ saṃkucitam	anavacchinnaḥ prakāśaḥ nija ānanda viśrāntaḥ śiva rūpaḥ saḥ eva svātantryāt ātmānam saṃkucitam 	Unrestricted light, resting in His own bliss, is of the nature of Śiva. He Himself, by His freedom, manifests Himself as contracted,
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-36']	avabhāsayan aṇur iti ucyate /	avabhāsayan aṇuḥ iti ucyate 	and is called the atom.

Even in having means,

Thus, the threefold division of immersion is by the division into Śāmbhava, Śākta, and Aṇava.
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-40']	tatra caturvidham api etad rūpaṃ krameṇa atra upadiśyate /	tatra caturvidham api etat rūpam krameṇa atra upadiśyate 	And there, all these four kinds of form are taught here in order.

There is no attainment of one's own nature, because of eternality, nor is there knowledge.

There is no penetration into it
['SA_GSP30_abhtantu-49']	anupraveṣṭuḥ vyatiriktasya abhāvāt // /	anupraveṣṭuḥ vyatiriktasya abhāvāt 	because there is no separate entity to penetrate into.
