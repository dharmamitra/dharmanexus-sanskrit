['SA_GSP29_muva-5', 'SA_GSP29_muva-6']	🔽i	Ro🔽Ro	Men engage in the means to an end only with a purpose in mind. Therefore, the authors of scriptures first display the purpose of the scripture. There, the intrinsic purpose is happiness, the experience of that, and the absence of pain. And reality is the state of being the object of a will that is not dependent on the will of another, but not the state of being a purpose when not producing another purpose. Because happiness, which produces the experience in the form of the direct perception of happiness, is not pervaded by being an object with respect to that experience. And the secondary purpose is food etc., which are the objects of a will that is dependent on the will of another. Because the will arises from the mere association with the result in the form of happiness etc. Just as heaven has the nature of happiness not mixed with pain, so also the result of the scriptures like logic has the intrinsic purpose of the cessation of extreme pain, which is liberation.

Or, it is like the nature of a lamp, because it is a continuum. And being a continuum is the state of being an effect of the destruction of the object that is not co-existent with itself. And the Vedic text The self should be known, he does not return again is the means of valid knowledge. The meaning is the embodied one returns, becomes. And the state of final liberation, which is of the nature stated, cannot be a human goal by being opposed to pleasure, because even if it is necessarily the absence of pleasure, it is not different from the absolute absence of pain, and because there is no obstruction to the production of desire for it, qualified and unqualified by that, it is logically possible that it is a human goal. And it should not be said that desire is not possible there because hatred is possible due to its being necessarily the absence of pleasure, because what is an end in itself cannot be the object of hatred. Now, liberation is the means to liberation by being the means to the cessation of pleasure through the knowledge of reality that destroys dharma etc., and is the means to liberation by being the means to the cessation of pleasure through the knowledge of reality that destroys dharma etc., and is the means to liberation by being the means to the cessation of pleasure through the knowledge of reality that destroys dharma etc., and is the means to liberation by being the means to the cessation of pleasure through the knowledge of reality that destroys dharma etc., and is the means to liberation by being the means to the cessation of pleasure through the knowledge of reality that destroys dharma etc., and is the means to liberation by being the means to the cessation of pleasure through the knowledge of reality that destroys dharma etc., and is the means to liberation by being the means to the cessation of pleasure through the knowledge of reality that destroys dharma etc., and is the means to liberation by being the means to the cessation of pleasure through the knowledge of reality that destroys dharma etc., and is the means to liberation by being the means to the cessation of

But those who are discerning, who think that in this wilderness of worldly existence there are only a few days of happiness, and that the rest are days of sorrow, and who consider this (world) to be like the circle of a furious serpent's hood, and who desire to abandon even happiness, they are entitled to this (path). But for the discerning, happiness is not intensely delightful, as it is mixed with much sorrow. And in the absence of that (intense delight), aversion is not intense. Thus, since the object of intense aversion is only an impediment to engagement, there is no impossibility of engagement in the means to liberation. Even in heaven, due to the fear of falling and the resulting sorrow, and due to its impermanence, the discerning do not have intense delight. The intensity of attachment and aversion is a specific quality that must be inferred from engagement and disengagement. And the collection of causes governing that is itself non-universal, consisting of the particular cognitions, etc. Even when the cognition that it is mixed with much sorrow, etc. is the same, the object of attachment and aversion is different.

But it is not the prior non-existence or absolute non-existence, because they are eternal and not to be accomplished. And since destruction is possible only from the special quality that arises immediately after, there is no use for the knowledge of reality etc. If it is argued that the state of final liberation, which is characterized by the cessation of suffering qualified by the property of being eternal, which is characterized by not being contemporaneous with the prior non-existence of suffering that is co-extensive with itself, cannot be brought about by any other cause independent of the knowledge of reality, even so, the property of that kind cannot be the differentia of what is produced by the knowledge of reality. Because in the state of the cessation of the last suffering, due to the absence of the cause in the form of the non-merit that produces suffering in the self that possesses it, the suffering does not arise. And due to the force of the meaning itself, the property of not being contemporaneous with the suffering that is co-extensive with itself is accomplished. Because what is grasped by the contradictory in the form of the connection with the meaning cannot be the differentia of the effect.

['SA_GSP29_muva-22']	i	Ro	But the Prabhakaras hold the following opinion: Liberation is the non-origination of pain, and that is of the nature of privation, and hence cannot be produced.

The existence of what has been accomplished at a subsequent time is the preservation of what has been obtained. The connection of privation with a subsequent time is the preservation of what is opposed to the production of the counter-entity. And the knowledge of the truth of the self, which is the cause of the destruction of the sin that has become the seed of pain, is itself opposed to the production of pain.

Even the prior non-existence of suffering, without any distinction, which is connected with a later time, is common to the state of worldly existence. Therefore, it should be said that liberation is only that which is qualified by the destruction of suffering not co-existent with itself, which is co-existent with suffering. And such a [liberation] is not well-known, because in the state of liberation, due to the non-arising of suffering for one who is liberated, the prior non-existence of that does not exist. Because only the future can be the counter-correlate of prior non-existence. And the desire expressed in the form May suffering not be mine etc. is only about the complete absence of suffering qualified by connection with a later and later time. Even if it is eternal, its being an object to be accomplished is not at all impaired, like prior non-existence. Liberation is the complete absence of suffering qualified by the absence of the prior non-existence of suffering. In the state of deep sleep etc., there is no over-extension due to the absence of the qualifier. Now, in the case of the result in the form of the alleviation of heat etc., which is to be accomplished by the prior means such as diving into a distant lake etc., and is qualified by the qualifier of being preceded by its means, it is easily stated that it is accomplished effortlessly by the prior means etc.

In the case of the destruction of evil produced by enjoyment and produced by expiation, the qualification is added to avoid over-extension. And it cannot be said that the actions that give rise to that body are destroyed only by enjoyment, even when the knowledge of truth has arisen, and for that very reason, even the knowers of truth like Narada etc. engage in the means of happiness and desist from the means of misery. And in that case, the destruction of evil produced by the knowledge of truth, being simultaneous with such evil, cannot fulfill the absoluteness as described. This cannot be said, because even when the knowledge of truth has arisen, the destruction of other evil occurs only when the actions of the body that have begun are exhausted by enjoyment itself, and not from another knowledge of truth. That alone is absolute.

It should be said that in accordance with the consideration of the contradiction of the statement beginning with may not be enjoyed, the knowledge of truth, by the means of producing a new body, immediately brings about the enjoyment of all actions and then destroys them. This is the intended meaning of the statements that indicate the knowledge of truth as the destroyer of actions. Just as fire has the indirect cause of the destruction of fuel and ashes, in the same way, the knowledge of truth also destroys actions. In order to indicate this, the knowledge is described as fire. And in the statement beginning with may not be enjoyed, the word action should not be taken as indirectly indicating unseen results, because it has the power only in the sense of action. If the indirect indication is necessary, let it be only in the unseen results that are not destroyed by knowledge etc. Then, in the refutation of contradiction, it should be said why the enjoyment of all actions of the knowers of truth is imagined even in that. Even in the unseen, the word action is used in the beginningless flow of usage.

That limiting adjunct is ignorance itself, so the cessation of that (ignorance) is itself (the state of isolation). Since sorrow is a property of the cognition of a particular internal organ, and that (cognition) is destroyed by the destruction of its own cause, ignorance, even though the cessation of ignorance has no intrinsic purpose, its being a secondary purpose is not easily refuted, because it is the cause of the cessation of sorrow. And ignorance, even though not produced, is the counter-correlate of destruction, and the knowledge of Brahman is its destroyer. And it should not be said that it is difficult to have the knowledge of Brahman itself when there is the existence of the covering in the form of ignorance, because the knowledge of Brahman is the modification of the internal organ in the form of Brahman, and that modification, which has the fruit of the cessation of ignorance that holds the object as a covering, is only the modification of the internal organ. This has been said (by Śaṅkara):

And manifestation is manifestation, and that is a separate entity like that of the Bhattas. And it should not be said that when Brahman is the object of the modification of the internal organ, there is a contradiction with the established conclusion that Brahman is of the nature of self-luminous consciousness, because the meaning of the word self-luminous is that which has its own manifestation as its object alone, by the derivation of the word as that which has its own manifestation as its object. For that which has manifestation from itself alone is said to be self-luminous. The manifestation of the inert self, the world, is not from itself alone, but rather from the result. And the reflection of consciousness in the object pervaded by modification is the conventional result. That is said:

By this, the knowledge of Brahman is the knowledge of Brahman. And thus, Brahman itself, which is in the form of knowledge of its own object, is so. Therefore, even in the state of worldly existence, due to its existence, the objection that there is the undesirable consequence of the cessation of ignorance is refuted. Because only the knowledge of Brahman, which is in the form of the activity of the internal organ, is the remover of ignorance. Since the activity in the form of Brahman does not exist in the state of worldly existence, the undesirable consequence of the cessation of ignorance does not arise.

Even though there is no difference between the Supreme Self and the individual soul, the individual soul is distinguished as the Self qualified by a particular limiting adjunct, and that very soul is distinguished from the Supreme Self by that limiting adjunct. Thus, the liberation of the individual soul in the Supreme Self is simply the absence of that distinguishing limiting adjunct, just as the dissolution of the space enclosed in a pot is simply the separation of the pot. Since the soul confined by the subtle body is the individual soul, liberation is concluded to be simply the destruction of the subtle body. And the subtle body consists of the aggregate of the subtle elements called Mahat, Ahamkāra, and Tanmātras, which are the seeds of the gross body. Since the soul distinguished by that very subtle body is qualified by suffering, etc., when the subtle body, which is the qualifier, is destroyed, suffering, etc. cannot arise. The qualifier here is included in the substratum, having the relation of delimitation. Or the subtle body alone is the substratum, because it is the cause of suffering in every way.

Let ignorance be either an unseen potentiality or a disposition implanted by false knowledge. But true knowledge is not directly the cause of the destruction of the unseen potentiality, but rather of the destruction of the intellect. Because the intellect is the substratum of knowledge and other mental states, and true knowledge is the destroyer of the relation of substratum in the form of the relation of inherence, due to its simplicity. And because true knowledge exists in the unseen potentiality only through the relation of co-inherence in the form of the relation of the same substratum, it is not the cause of the destruction of the unseen potentiality by the relation of inherence in the form of the cause of the destruction of the substratum of the destroyed object, due to the complexity of the relation of proximity that determines the cause of the destruction. And it cannot be said that knowledge is accepted as the cause of the destruction of the unseen potentiality only through the relation of proximity with the counter-correlate, and that it should be accepted as the cause of the destruction of the unseen potentiality only through the relation of inherence with the substratum of the destroyed object. Because, in that case, there would be the fallacy of over-extension due to the absence of a determining factor. Thus, even by accepting true knowledge as a separate cause in the destruction of dispositions, there is no logical difficulty.

And thus, even though bliss exists, due to the absence of pain, there is no contradiction by the existence of the non-existence of both. Or, the avoidance of split-of-the-sentence is by the purport of the non-existence qualified by the form which is pervasive and continuous. The acceptance of the method is not the best, because it is possible only by the statement of the dear and the not-dear in one word, and because even by that much, the non-avoidance of unfitness. The non-existence of both due to the absence of pain or due to the absence of bliss should not be suspected. It should be said that the absence of pain is authoritative by the power of the Upanisadic text which says that he is completely liberated from pain and moves on, etc., and that alone is the cause of the non-existence of both.

In reality, because the body is the cause in regard to knowledge only in the relation of the qualifier and the qualified, and because the realization of eternal bliss does not arise anywhere in that relation, it is possible even for one without a body.

Even if the cause of true knowledge is so, the form of liberation is proper only for the absolute cessation of suffering etc. The assumption of the manifestation of eternal bliss etc. is itself defeated by the heaviness of the burden. In the statement The form of Brahman is bliss, the word bliss is established in liberation as denoting the absence of suffering. Its meaning is: It remains without an upper limit in the cessation of false knowledge along with its impressions. The knowledge of the truth of the self is the cause of liberation, according to the Vedic text: The self is to be heard, to be thought, to be reflected upon, to be seen. O dear one, this much is immortality. This much knowledge in the form of hearing etc. is immortality, the cause of immortality, i.e., liberation. The reason for that is: The hearing which is capable of uprooting false knowledge along with its impressions is the cause of the knowledge of the truth of the self.

And it cannot be said that the direct perception of God is the remover of the false knowledge having the self as its object, not by the way of removing the contrary knowledge, but that the direct perception of the truth of the self alone is the cause of liberation, because the direct perception of God is the remover of false knowledge only by destroying the fault in the form of impressions. Even if the direct perception of God does not remove contrary knowledge, there is no harm in accepting that it destroys the impressions produced by false knowledge independently. Because the impression and the contrary knowledge are different from each other, and the relation of the destroyer and the destroyed does not hold between them. And since the direct perception of the self which comprehends the difference of the body is to be imagined as the cause of the destruction of the impression of the non-difference of the self and the body, there is no occasion for the theory that the direct perception of God is the destroyer of that (impression), because it is too complicated. Or let there be the use of the direct perception of the truth of the self for the destruction of the impressions. The self alone is to be known as the truth, both as the object of the relation and as the counter-correlate.

Thus, the husband, son, etc. are the objects of affection in the form of being the means of accomplishing one's own happiness, etc. There, the word 'ātman' refers to the individual self, not to the Supreme Self, because the latter is devoid of happiness. Even for those who consider it bliss, the bliss of the Supreme Self is accepted as eternal, so it cannot be the object of desire. In statements like 'The self alone is dear to all beings, O King', the self alone is said to be the unconditional beloved. Thus, since the self alone is introduced, the statement 'The self is to be heard in the Vāra' and so on conveys that the knowledge of one's own self alone is the cause of liberation, not of the Supreme Self. And the knowledge of the truth of one's own self is not useful in the absolute cessation of suffering through the destruction of false knowledge, impressions, virtue and vice, because such knowledge is not the means of destroying them.

Or how is the establishment of the cause for liberation, which is common, with regard to the uncommon specific knowledge and actions?

And in the case of the counter-entity, pain, or sin, one cannot avoid deviation by postulating specific classes and accepting that they are the determiners of the relation of the counter-entity restricted by them to the counter-entity residing in themselves, because there is no scope for postulating a class due to the contingence of confusion with the classes that determine the production of cow-killing, etc. And it cannot be said that there is no contingence of confusion due to accepting the plurality of those classes that determine the production of cow-killing, etc., because that plurality of them is determined by the plurality of those classes that determine the production of cow-killing, etc.

Everywhere the knowledge of the truth of the self is directly the cause of liberation, and the death at Kashi etc. are the means of liberation only through the door of that knowledge. The scriptures which teach the non-liberating nature of death at Kashi etc. do not have that as their object, but rather their purpose is to motivate. For this very reason, even though there is an aggregation of death at Kashi etc. along with knowledge as door and that which enters through the door, the conclusion that there is an aggregation in a case where many causes are taught by the Veda without any connection is not contradicted. Because it is possible to imagine specific universals as the determiners of the nature of death at Kashi etc. which are mental in the mental knowledge of truth, and there is no opportunity for mutual deviation. And because the arising of knowledge is not possible with the dead body as the substratum, the taking up of another body after death at Kashi etc. is also imagined, because there is no other way. As for the teaching of Tara by Lord Mahesvara, it is only in the state of being about to die, because it is not possible to teach one who is dead. And thus the scripture

And after death at Kāśī, the Lord utters the Tāraka (mantra) in the ear. And some say that the utterance of that (mantra) produces the knowledge of the truth of the self through the unseen (force), even without producing the knowledge in the body that is delimited by that (mantra), in the body that is subsequently taken. Even though the death at Kāśī, at Gaṅgā, etc., can be combined through the unseen (force), the cause is only optional by the reason stated, like the grass, etc., and fire. And it should not be said that there is the contingence of the non-production of the fruit by the death at Kāśī and at Gaṅgā, which are combined, like the rice and barley. Because of the inequality. It is thus: Since the rice and barley are enjoined as the means of sacrifice in one section in succession, and since there is no desire for another means due to the attainment of barley as the means in the first place, the sacrifice without rice as the means is the means of the fruit by the desire for the principal alternative, What is the means of the fruit?
