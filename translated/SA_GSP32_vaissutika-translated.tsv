(Chandogya Upanishad 8.12.1). Having reflected on this statement, he came to Kanabhaksha. Then he said: 'Blessed one, by this statement, the means of attaining peace for one whose body has been removed is being described. Please tell me, what is the means?' Then the sage said: 'Dharma.' Then the Brahmin said: 'What is Dharma? What are its characteristics? What are its means? What is its purpose? To whom does it provide help?' Therefore, after these questions, in the promise to explain Dharma, the word 'atha' expresses immediacy. The word 'ataḥ' also indicates the student's qualities such as the ripening of the stories of detachment and wisdom as the cause. Since this student is endowed with good qualities, therefore, after these questions, Dharma is explained.

Fasting is the observance of not eating, preceded by the vow, day and night. The word Brahman refers to the Self. Brahmacharya is the union of the mind and Self with Brahman, which is the avoidance of women and other objects of desire. Living in the Guru's house is for one who seeks knowledge and other things, and who serves the Guru, residing in his house. A Vanaprastha is one who has left his home according to the injunctions of the scriptures and has gone to the forest. His duties are those of a Vanaprastha. Sacrifices are the Pakayajnas and others. Giving is the giving of gold and other things, and the giving of fearlessness. Sprinkling is the worship of the Sandhya and other rites. Other special rules are the rules regarding direction, etc. The rule regarding direction is that one should eat facing east. The rule regarding constellations is that one should study under the constellation Krittika. The rule regarding mantras is that one offers oblations with the mantra Devasya tvā. The rule regarding time is that a Brahmin should establish the sacred fires in spring. Thus, all this has a visible purpose, but the purpose of the Vedas is not visible.
