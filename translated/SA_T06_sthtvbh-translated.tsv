['SA_T06_sthtvbh-3']	pudgaladharmanairātmyapratipādanaṃ punaḥ kleśajñeyāvaraṇaprahāṇārtham /	pudgala dharma nairātmya pratipādanam punar kleśa jñeya āvaraṇa prahāṇa artham 	The teaching of the non-self of persons and phenomena is again for the purpose of abandoning the obscurations of afflictions and the knowable.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-4', 'SA_T06_sthtvbh-5']	tathā hy ātmadṛṣṭiprabhavā rāgādayaḥ kleśāḥ pudgalanairātmyāvabodhaś ca satkāyadṛṣṭeḥ pratipakṣatvāt tatprahāṇāya pravartamānaḥ sarvakleśān 🔽prajahāti /	tathā hi ātma dṛṣṭi prabhavāḥ rāga ādayaḥ kleśāḥ pudgala nairātmya avabodhaḥ ca sat kāya dṛṣṭeḥ pratipakṣa tvāt tad prahāṇāya pravartamānaḥ sarva kleśān  prajahāti 	For thus, the afflictions such as desire arise from the view of self, and the realization of the non-self of persons is the antidote to the view of the transitory collection. Engaging in that for the purpose of abandoning it, one abandons all afflictions.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-6']	dharmanairātmyajñānād api jñeyāvaraṇapratipakṣatvāt jñeyāvaraṇaṃ prahīyate /	dharma nairātmya jñānāt api jñeya āvaraṇa pratipakṣa tvāt jñeya āvaraṇam prahīyate 	And from the knowledge of the non-self of phenomena, the obscuration of the knowable is abandoned because it is the antidote to the obscuration of the knowable.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-7']	kleśajñeyāvaraṇaprahāṇam api mokṣasarvajñatvādhigamārtham /	kleśa jñeya āvaraṇa prahāṇam api mokṣa sarvajña tva adhigama artham 	The abandonment of the obscurations of afflictions and the knowable is again for the purpose of attaining liberation and omniscience.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-8']	kleśā hi mokṣaprāpter āvaraṇam iti atas teṣu prahīṇeṣu mokṣo 'dhigamyate /	kleśāḥ hi mokṣa prāpteḥ āvaraṇam iti atas teṣu prahīṇeṣu mokṣaḥ dhigamyate 	For afflictions are the obscuration to attaining liberation. Therefore, when they are abandoned, liberation is attained.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-9']	jñeyāvaraṇam api sarvasmin jñeye jñānapravṛttipratibandhabhūtam akliṣṭam ajñānam /	jñeya āvaraṇam api sarvasmin jñeye jñāna pravṛtti pratibandha bhūtam akliṣṭam ajñānam 	The obscuration of the knowable is undefiled nescience that is an obstruction to the arising of knowledge in regard to all that is to be known.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-10', 'SA_T06_sthtvbh-11']	tasmin prahīṇe sarvākāre jñeye 'saktam apratihatañ ca jñānaṃ pravartata ity ataḥ sarvajñatvam adhigamyate /🔽atha vā dharmapudgalābhiniviṣṭāś cittamātraṃ yathābhūtaṃ na jānantīty ato dharmapudgalanairātmyapradarśanena saphale vijñaptimātre 'nupūrveṇa 	tasmin prahīṇe sarva ākāre jñeye saktam a pratihatam ca jñānam pravartate iti atas sarvajña tvam adhigamyate  atha vā dharma pudgala abhiniviṣṭāḥ cittamātram yathā bhūtam na jānanti iti atas dharma pudgala nairātmya pradarśanena saphale vijñaptimātre nupūrveṇa 	When that is eliminated, knowledge proceeds unimpeded and unobstructed regarding all aspects of the knowable. Therefore, omniscience is attained.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-12']	praveśārthaṃ prakaraṇārambhaḥ /	praveśa artham prakaraṇa ārambhaḥ 	Or, those who are attached to the belief in the self of phenomena and individuals do not know mind-only as it is. Therefore, in order to gradually introduce them to the fruitful mere representation of consciousness, by demonstrating the selflessness of phenomena and individuals, the treatise is begun.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-13']	atha vā vijñānavad vijñeyam api dravyata eveti kecin manyante /	atha vā vijñāna vat vijñeyam api dravyataḥ eva iti kecid manyante 	Or, some think that the knowable exists substantially just like consciousness.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-14']	vijñeyavad vijñānam api saṃvṛtita eva na paramārthata ity asya dviprakārasyāpy ekāntavādasya pratiṣedhārthaḥ prakaraṇārambhaḥ //	vijñeya vat vijñānam api saṃvṛtitaḥ eva na paramārthataḥ iti asya dvi prakārasya api ekānta vādasya pratiṣedha arthaḥ prakaraṇa ārambhaḥ 	In order to refute both of these extreme views, that the knowable exists substantially and that consciousness exists substantially, the treatise is begun.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-15']	ātmadharmopacāro hi vividho yaḥ pravartate /	ātma dharma upacāraḥ hi vividhaḥ yaḥ pravartate 	The various designations of self and phenomena

The designation of dharmas refers to the aggregates, elements, sense bases, form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, and so on.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-23']	ayaṃ dviprakāro 'py upacāro vijñānapariṇāma eva na mukhye ātmani dharmeṣu ceti /	ayam dvi prakāraḥ upacāraḥ vijñāna pariṇāmaḥ eva na mukhye ātmani dharmeṣu ca iti 	This twofold designation is only a transformation of consciousness, not in the primary self or dharmas.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-24']	kuta etat /	kutas etat 	Why is this?
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-25']	dharmāṇām ātmanaś ca vijñānapariṇāmād bahir abhāvāt /	dharmāṇām ātmanaḥ ca vijñāna pariṇāmāt bahis abhāvāt 	Because dharmas and the self do not exist apart from the transformation of consciousness.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-26']	ko 'yaṃ pariṇāmo nāma /	kaḥ yam pariṇāmaḥ nāma 	What is this so-called transformation?
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-27']	anyathātvam /	anyathātvam 	It is a change in state.

['SA_T06_sthtvbh-31']	vināpi bāhyenātmanā dharmaiś ca /	vinā api bāhyena ātmanā dharmaiḥ ca 	Even without an external self and phenomena.

['SA_T06_sthtvbh-33']	yac ca yatra nāsti tat tatropacaryate /	yat ca yatra na asti tat tatra upacaryate 	And what does not exist in something is metaphorically applied to it.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-34']	tad yathā bāhīke gauḥ /	tat yathā bāhīke gauḥ 	Just as a cow is metaphorically applied to a calf.

Therefore, the extreme view that the object of consciousness also exists as a substance like consciousness should not be accepted.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-37']	upacārasya ca nirādhārasyāsaṃbhavād avaśyaṃ vijñānapariṇāmo vastuto 'stīty upagantavyo yatrātmadharmopacāraḥ pravartate /	upacārasya ca nirādhārasya asaṃbhavāt avaśyam vijñāna pariṇāmaḥ vastutas sti iti upagantavyaḥ yatra ātma dharma upacāraḥ pravartate 	And because a metaphor cannot exist without a basis, it must be accepted that the transformation of consciousness exists as a reality, where the metaphorical application of self and phenomena occurs.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-38']	ataś cāyam abhyupagamo na yuktikṣamo vijñānam api vijñeyavat saṃvṛtita eva na paramārthata iti /	atas ca ayam abhyupagamaḥ na yukti kṣamaḥ vijñānam api vijñeya vat saṃvṛtitaḥ eva na paramārthataḥ iti 	And therefore, this acceptance that consciousness also exists only as a convention, like the object of consciousness, and not ultimately, is not tenable as reasoning.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-39']	saṃvṛtito 'py abhāvaprasaṅgān na hi saṃvṛtir nirupādānā yujyate /	saṃvṛtitaḥ pi abhāva prasaṅgāt na hi saṃvṛtiḥ nirupādānā yujyate 	Because it would lead to the consequence of non-existence even conventionally, for a convention cannot be tenable without a basis.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-40']	tasmād ayam ekāntavādo dviprakāro 'pi niryuktikatvāt tyājya ity ācāryavacanam /	tasmāt ayam ekāntavādaḥ dvi prakāraḥ niryuktika tvāt tyājyaḥ iti ācārya vacanam 	Therefore, this extreme view of two kinds is to be abandoned because it is unreasonable, as stated by the master.

But consciousness, being dependently arisen, must be accepted as existing as a substance.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-42']	pratītyasamutpannatvaṃ punar vijñānasya pariṇāmaśabdena jñāpitam /	pratītyasamutpanna tvam punar vijñānasya pariṇāma śabdena jñāpitam 	And the dependent origination of consciousness is indicated by the word transformation.

['SA_T06_sthtvbh-45']	sañcitālambanāś ca pañcavijñānakāyās tadākāratvāt /	sañcita ālambanāḥ ca pañca vijñāna kāyāḥ tad ākāra tvāt 	And the five groups of consciousness have accumulated objects as their objects, because they have that form.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-46']	na ca sañcitam avayavasaṃhatimātrād anyad vidyate /	na ca sañcitam avayava saṃhati mātrāt anyat vidyate 	And nothing other than an accumulation of parts is found.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-47']	tadavayavān apohya sañcitākāravijñānābhāvāt /	tad avayavān apohya sañcita ākāra vijñāna abhāvāt 	Because, having excluded those parts, there is no consciousness with the form of an accumulation.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-48']	tasmād vinaiva bāhyenārthena vijñānaṃ sañcitākāram utpadyate /	tasmāt vinā eva bāhyena arthena vijñānam sañcita ākāram utpadyate 	Therefore, without an external object, consciousness arises in the form of an accumulation.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-49']	na ca paramāṇava eva saṃcitās tasyālambanaṃ paramāṇūnām atadākāratvāt /	na ca paramāṇavaḥ eva saṃcitāḥ tasya ālambanam paramāṇūnām a tad ākāra tvāt 	And the accumulated atoms themselves are not the object of that [consciousness], because atoms do not have that form.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-50']	na hy asañcitāvasthātaḥ sañcitāvasthāyāṃ paramāṇūnāṃ kaścid ātmātiśayaḥ /	na hi asañcita avasthātaḥ sañcita avasthāyām paramāṇūnām kaścid ātma atiśayaḥ 	For the atoms have no difference in self at all from the uncombined state to the combined state.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-51']	tasmād asañcitavat sañcitā api paramāṇavo naivālambanam /	tasmāt a sañcita vat sañcitāḥ api paramāṇavaḥ na eva ālambanam 	Therefore, like the uncombined, the combined atoms also are not the object of cognition.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-52']	anyas tu manyate /	anyaḥ tu manyate 	But another [master] thinks:
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-53']	ekaika paramāṇur anyanirapekṣyo 'tīndriyo bahavas tu parasparāpekṣā indriyagrāhyāḥ /	ekaikaḥ paramāṇuḥ anya nirapekṣyaḥ tīndriyaḥ bahavaḥ tu paraspara apekṣāḥ indriya grāhyāḥ 	Each atom, independent of others, is imperceptible, but many, dependent on each other, are perceptible to the senses.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-54']	teṣām api sāpekṣanirapekṣāvasthayor ātmātiśayābhāvād ekāntenendriyagrāhyatvam atīndriyatvaṃ vā /	teṣām api sāpekṣa nirapekṣa avasthayoḥ ātma atiśaya abhāvāt ekāntena indriya grāhya tvam atīndriya tvam vā 	Even for them, because there is no difference in self between the dependent and independent states, they are either always perceptible to the senses or always imperceptible.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-55']	yadi ca paramāṇava eva parasparāpekṣā vijñānasya viṣayībhavanti /	yadi ca paramāṇavaḥ eva paraspara apekṣāḥ vijñānasya viṣayībhavanti 	And if only the atoms, dependent on each other, become the object of consciousness,

['SA_T06_sthtvbh-57']	na cānyanirbhāsasya vijñānasyānyākāro viṣayo yujyate 'tiprasaṅgāt /	na ca anya nirbhāsasya vijñānasya anya ākāraḥ viṣayaḥ yujyate tiprasaṅgāt 	And it is not reasonable for the object of consciousness appearing as one thing to have a form of another thing, because of the absurdity [of the consequence].
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-58']	na ca paramāṇavaḥ stambhādivat paramārthataḥ santy/	na ca paramāṇavaḥ stambha ādi vat paramārthataḥ santi 	And the atoms do not really exist as pillars, etc.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-59']	arvāṅmadhyaparabhāgasadbhāvāt /	arvāk madhya para bhāga sadbhāvāt 	Because of the existence of the front, middle, and back parts.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-60']	tadanabhyupagame vā pūrvadakṣiṇāparottarādidigbhedo yaḥ sa paramāṇor na syāt /	tad anabhyupagame vā pūrva dakṣiṇa apara uttara ādi diś bhedaḥ yaḥ sa paramāṇoḥ na syāt 	If you do not accept that, then the distinction of east, south, west, north, etc. would not exist for the atom.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-61']	tataś ca vijñānavat paramāṇor apy amūrtatvam adeśasthatvañ ca prasajyate /	tatas ca vijñāna vat paramāṇoḥ api amūrta tvam adeśa stha tvam ca prasajyate 	And from that, it follows that the atom, like consciousness, would be immaterial and not located in space.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-62']	evaṃ bāhyārthābhāvād vijñānam evārthākāram utpadyate svapnavijñānavad ity abhyupeyam /	evam bāhya artha abhāvāt vijñānam eva artha ākāram utpadyate svapna vijñāna vat iti abhyupeyam 	Thus, because external objects do not exist, consciousness itself arises in the form of objects, like consciousness in a dream. This should be accepted.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-63']	vedanādayo 'pi nātītānāgatās tadākāravijñānajanakā niruddhājātatvāt /	vedanā ādayaḥ pi na atīta anāgatāḥ tad ākāra vijñāna janakāḥ niruddha a jāta tvāt 	Feelings, etc. are also not past or future, because they do not produce consciousness in their form, being ceased or unborn.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-64']	na ca vartamānā vartamānajanakā utpadyamānāvasthāyām asattvāt /	na ca vartamānāḥ vartamāna janakāḥ utpadyamāna avasthāyām asattvāt 	And they are not present, because they do not produce the present, because they do not exist in the state of arising.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-65']	utpannāvasthāyāṃ vijñānasyāpi tadākāreṇotpannatvān na kiñcit kartavyam astīti manovijñānam apy anālambanam evotpadyate /	utpanna avasthāyām vijñānasya api tad ākāreṇa utpanna tvāt na kiñcid kartavyam asti iti manaḥ vijñānam api anālambanam eva utpadyate 	And in the state of arising, since consciousness has already arisen in its form, there is nothing to be done. Thus mental consciousness also arises without an object.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-66']	anyas tv āha /	anyaḥ tu āha 	But another says:
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-67']	asaty ātmani mukhye dharmeṣu copacāro na yujyate /	asati ātmani mukhye dharmeṣu ca upacāraḥ na yujyate 	When there is no primary self and dharmas, figurative use is not reasonable.

['SA_T06_sthtvbh-70']	atra hy agnir māṇavaka iti jātir dravyaṃ vopacaryate /	atra hi agniḥ māṇavakaḥ iti jātiḥ dravyam vā upacaryate 	Here, either the class or the substance is figuratively applied to the fire as the boy.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-71']	ubhayathāpy upacārābhāvaḥ /	ubhayathā api upacāra abhāvaḥ 	In both cases, there is no figurative application.

['SA_T06_sthtvbh-75']	jātyavinābhāvitvān māṇavake jātyupacāro bhaviṣyati /	jāti avinābhāvi tvāt māṇavake jāti upacāraḥ bhaviṣyati 	Even though it is not its property, the figurative application of the class to the boy will be due to the invariable concomitance of sharpness and tawny color with the class.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-76']	jātyabhāve 'pi tīkṣṇatvakapilatvayor māṇavake darśanād avinābhāvitvam ayuktam /	jāti abhāve pi tīkṣṇa tva kapila tvayoḥ māṇavake darśanāt avinābhāvi tvam ayuktam 	But since sharpness and tawny color are seen in the boy even in the absence of the class, invariable concomitance is not proper.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-77']	avinābhāvitve copacārābhāvo 'gnāv iva māṇavake 'pi jātisadbhāvāt /	avinābhāvi tve ca upacāra abhāvaḥ gnau iva māṇavake pi jāti sadbhāvāt 	And if there is invariable concomitance, there is no figurative application, because the class exists in the boy just as in the fire.
['SA_T06_sthtvbh-78']	tasmān na māṇavake jātyupacāraḥ saṃbhavati /	tasmāt na māṇavake jāti upacāraḥ saṃbhavati 	Therefore, the figurative application of the class to the boy is not possible.
