Goraksha Yoga Shastra, also called Mulasara, the essence of the root, is a work on yoga written in the manner of a stotra, so that by reading and reciting it daily, one accrues countless benefits. It opens with a summary of the contents of the subtle body, the vital channels, sun, moon and fire, the chakras and sacred Kaula sites, the self that resides there, the worlds, oceans, rivers - all that is in the egg of Brahma is in the body. The moon on the peak of the inner Mount Meru rains down nectar throughout the body, and so it goes on describing the activity and function of the inner contents of the body listed at the beginning. The treatise, as its very name suggests, is a summary of the root text, the Goraksha Shatka, which is a collection of six works on yoga by Gorakshanatha. The Mulasara is a concise and essential guide to the practice of yoga, covering topics such as the subtle body, the chakras, the vital energies, and the ultimate goal of liberation. The text is written in a poetic style, with each verse containing a single line of prose followed by a line of commentary. The commentary is often brief and cryptic, requiring the reader to have a deep understanding of the root text in order to fully grasp its meaning. The Mulasara is considered one of the most important works on yoga in the Nath Siddha tradition, and has been studied and practiced by yogis for centuries.
