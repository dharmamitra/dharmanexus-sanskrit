['SA_GR14_utajp_pu-27']	evam arthakriyābhāsopādhisaṃbhedam āgataḥ /	evam artha kriyā ābhāsa upādhi saṃbhedam āgataḥ 	Thus, the object, having come to be distinguished by the superimposition of the appearance of the performance of an effect,

Even in the case of an existent object, the existence of an object in the form of an object is not established by the means of valid knowledge, because of the non-establishment of consciousness in the aforementioned manner.

['SA_GR14_utajp_pu-36']	saṃvid apy aparāmarśarūpā cet tad asāv api /	saṃvid api a parāmarśa rūpā ced tat asau api 	If consciousness is also in the form of non-reflection, then that is also so.
