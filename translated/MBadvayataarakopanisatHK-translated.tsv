In its middle, there is the well-known Kundalini, with a body as subtle as a lotus fiber, having a brilliance equal to that of a crore of lightning bolts.

If one sees her by the continuous flashing of the light of the star in the special circle of the forehead above the eyebrows, one becomes accomplished. In the two ear holes opened by the tip of the index finger, a hissing sound is produced. When the mind is fixed there, by looking at the place of the blue light in the middle of the eye with inner vision, one attains supreme bliss. Thus one sees in the heart.

As a non-yogin sees the sun and moon in the universe with the stars aided by the mind, so the yogin should look at the sun and moon shining in the sky of his head with the stars aided by the mind. The meaning is that seeing forms depends on the eyes, so what is the use of the mind? To this he says that. When the mind is engaged elsewhere, the eye etc. do not have the power to grasp forms etc. This is because there is no seeing when the mind is elsewhere, and no hearing when the mind is elsewhere, as stated in the Vedas. Since it is so, therefore.

That which ends with the senses is embodied. That which is beyond the eyebrows is disembodied. In all discrimination of internal objects, practice connected with the mind is desired. By the two Tāraka, due to the vision of the existent located above, the Brahman which is the nature of existence, consciousness, and bliss, is connected with the internal eye along with the mind. Therefore, it is established that Brahman is made of white light. That Brahman becomes knowable by the internal vision of the eye aided by the mind. Thus, the embodied Tāraka also. By the eye connected with the mind alone, the subtle body etc. become knowable. Because the purpose of grasping form depends on the mind and eye, and because the effect of grasping form arises only through the non-conjunction of the internal and external self, mind, and eye. Therefore, the internal vision connected with the mind becomes the light of the Tāraka.

The discrimination of internal objects is dependent on the mind and eyes, like the discrimination of external objects. Therefore, it is said everywhere (sarvatra). Because of seeing beings above that (tat ūrdhva-sattva-darśanāt).

By one united with the mind (manaḥ-yuktena). Brahman alone is the mark of the upper tārā. This is to be meditated upon (anu-saṃ-dhātavyam). Since it is so, therefore (tasmāt). Although the shining white light located in the middle of the eyebrows and so on is imagined by the mind, Brahman, being all-pervading, exists there also. Therefore, the mind dissolves into that Brahman with the firmness of conviction (abhimati-dṛḍhimnā). When the mind dissolves there, the imagination that requires an imaginer being absent, Brahman alone, which is free from conceptualization, remains. This is the meaning.
