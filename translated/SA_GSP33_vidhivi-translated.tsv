And a means of knowledge is that which causes understanding. There, causing the understanding of some excess of meaning that is the cause of engagement, the word attains the status of an injunction. But if it itself were the cause of engagement, it would abandon that status of being a means of knowledge. For a cause is not a means of knowledge, but rather an indicator.

For just as people act from the mere knowledge of the connection with the form of what is to be done, as in One should act from the sound of the conch, not others, and the sound of the conch is not the conveyor of the idea of action or of any other cause of action, by which it could be an indicator. This is irrelevant. For the sound of the conch is not the cause of action by being connected with what is useful for action, as in One should act from the sound of the conch, but rather as in One should act. And it reminds one of that by being the cause of the recollection of the convention made by the person to be enjoined with regard to the meaning of the suffix, which is different from the meaning of the root. Then those who conform to that act. It is also false that those who do not know the object do not act because they do not know the convention. Because even one who knows only that connection would be subject to that. And in action dependent on the word, where there is no prior cognition, the experience of the object would not be useful, like one impelled by a strong wind.

If it is argued that the activity is connected with the meaning of the root by the suffix itself, that cannot be said by those who maintain that the injunction is by the word, because the bhāvanā (activity) cannot be of the nature of an effect and is not denoted by the suffix. Then, in that case, the suffix like that has a connection as a kāraka (instrumental cause). But the co-mention (of the suffix and the root) is of that (activity). Either what is denoted or what is indicated by that (suffix) obtains a connection with something of that kind, because it is not possible to connect what is not known. But in the case of the activity which is an effect, there is no cause for restriction, because of the cause of activity which is not denoted. Moreover, in the case of those whose result is not heard, there is the assumption of a result. In some cases, there is the assumption of an aid to the sacrifice. Even in the case of those whose result is heard, like heaven etc., there is the determination of their being the result. Thus, all this is the greatness of the injunction. That is not possible in the case of the word. For, then, what is not understood from the word is not understood in another way. For, the form of the suffix etc.

For when a word is an instrument with regard to activity, even if it exists, the expression of its operation is not a factor. Because it is an instrument even when its operation is not expressed. Because an instrument does not require knowledge. But even accepting the use of the word, we say: The person does not engage in activity. Because even if the word impels, it is not to be followed. For the wise do not engage in activity with regard to every impeller, but rather with regard to one who is to be obeyed. And the word does not have the cause of obeying, like a master, in the form of providing what is not obtained or avoiding what is obtained. If it is argued that it is useless because activity occurs from the result itself, that is not so. Because the result is not appropriate.

Because this (injunction) is not different. If it is different due to the difference in denotation, then that alone is the cause of activity, as shown by positive and negative concomitance. But it is established that the meaning of a word is not obtained from anything else. Therefore, it is not proper to say that the denotation of a word, which is to be inferred from the effect, is the meaning of a word. And if denotation requires another denotation, there would be an infinite regress. If it is argued that only the denotation of the meaning requires it, it is not so. Because there is no determining reason. And because of the denotation of the meaning. For there is no reason here. That only the denotation of the meaning requires it, not the denotation.

Because a general property without distinctions is not possible, and because activity is not possible without an agent. First, instigation and so on are not possible as distinctions in the Veda. Nor is any other distinction shown. If it were shown, then the establishment of the general expression at this time would be pointless. Therefore, this general instigation, devoid of distinctions, would be like Brahminhood, devoid of distinctions like Katha and so on. And instigation is the activity of the instigator. That is not very clear without him, because there is no person, and because the activity of instigating is denied to the word.

Now, if the exclusion of the past etc. is not verbal, but is ascertained by another means of knowledge due to its neutrality, then it is not confined to something else, because its being so is ascertained by another means of knowledge.

It will not be so, because only the object to be accomplished is the qualifying factor, and because it is desired. Even so, there is no evidence for the connection with the object, because even that which is to be accomplished by another can be the qualifying factor, and because desire is seen to be based on mere will. But the understanding of the person's eligibility for the rite is possible only in the means of desire, not otherwise. That would be done by the person to be enjoined.

How could it be his duty? What benefit is there to him other than the desired result? The word 'desiring' would be meaningless in another benefit. If there is a relation of the one to be benefited and the other to benefit, then the purpose of the injunction is that. What follows from that? The quality of being an instructor is lost. And dependence due to the restatement of an established fact. Therefore, the purpose of the injunction is that this should be done by him, because of the understanding of performance, and because of the invariable concomitance. And because the benefit is not relied upon in the case of the injunction of the occasional and the prohibitive. And the injunction is not in the action itself for the purpose of the one to be employed. For this very reason, there is no injunction in the worldly request etc. But heaven is a qualifier, not an indication. Let there be the connection of this with the injunction. But the injunction itself does not establish the connection of the sacrifice. In this way, a person like this is employed, just as in 'he whose fire burns the house'.

For in the world, the connection of words is governed by the speaker's intention, while in the Veda it is governed by injunction. This is another boil on top of a tumor. If indeed the power of the word is understood from the world in the case of a connection governed by the speaker's intention, not in the case of one governed by another meaning, because the power of the word is not based on anything else. If it is argued that it is because there is no speaker, this very connection governed by the speaker's intention would make one infer that. Thus it follows that it is human. Or if there is no understanding, or if there is understanding, it would not be based on the word, but on convention, or on the inference of a general rule. Therefore, your confusion about the injunction being the cause of action arises only from the use of words with secondary meaning. Moreover, mere injunction is not the cause of action in the world, because everyone would not act if it were, and because it would exist even when there is no injunction. And being subject to injunction is the cause of action, because one acts due to the injunction of another. And the cause of being subject is the attainment of benefit and avoidance of harm in this world.

But the mundane [eloquence] is mostly based on the appearance of signs such as the simultaneous arising of mental clarity and agitation that have as their object the pleasant and unpleasant. Therefore, they designate it as eloquence, not as a definite cognition, because it has the nature of uncertainty. It is not of the nature of doubt, because it touches both ends and is equal. It is only eloquence, not a means of valid knowledge, because its result is uncertain. Because the definite cognition depends on another means of valid knowledge. In the same way, because it depends on the categories such as inference, there is dependence even there. Otherwise, without depending on that, the connection of the mind alone with external objects would be for everyone in everything at all times. Because of the unseen difference, the mind that does not depend on the signs of the senses would be engaged in external objects even when they do not exist, leading to the absurdity of the eye, etc. being purposeless. Because all understanding is accomplished from that which is produced by the unseen difference, that [mind] would also be purposeless. Because the self, which is not an agent, is the experiencer.

Even in the absence of the characteristic of inference, there would be perception in the perception of an existing object through memory, because the impression is the cause there, not the existence of the object. Because it exists even when the object does not exist. It is the same in the other case also. Because the dharma born of yoga is the cause. For there is no proof of the use of the object. Because it is accepted that the perception of the yogi arises everywhere, whether the object is present or absent, near or far, obstructed or unobstructed, past or future.

For one who sees it as having the nature of the present, it is false knowledge, because everything does not exist in that way. But for one who sees it as it really is, it is not perception, because it does not have the past and future as its object. Or else, this [perception] must necessarily have one definition among the many kinds of perception. Otherwise, the statement that it is a different means of knowledge would be groundless, or the acceptance of a different means of knowledge would be meaningless, because of the absence of purpose in the definition. Even among those with different definitions, some people use the word 'perception' in common usage. Therefore, because it is not possible in false cognition, it is not possible in inference either. There, being produced from the senses is not the definition, because it is too broad for the mind. Therefore, being produced from the object in contact with the senses is its definition. As it is said: Arising by the power of the object, it is contact with the object produced from the contact of the senses. It is association. If the mind were a sense, it would be pervaded by the knowledge of pleasure etc.

If it is the representation of a non-existent object, this is the same in all omniscient cognitions. If it is the representation of a completely non-existent object, then the cognition of one with cataracts or in a dream is perception. If being non-erroneous means being in agreement with effective action, then the cognition of what is not fit to be adopted or rejected would be erroneous, as it does not lead to the attainment of pleasure or the avoidance of pain that are dependent on objects. If being non-erroneous means the occurrence of subsequent cognitions, then momentary consciousness would not be non-erroneous. Therefore, the appearance of identity in what is not of that nature is error. And thus the cognition of an omniscient one is not free from conceptualization and is not non-erroneous, so it does not conform to the definition of perception. However, it conforms because it operates in the form of experience, as stated: Mental [cognition] is also perception, operating in the form of experience. Now, what is this form of experience? If it is the nature of being awareness, then all cognition is like that. If it is the appearance of a different individual, then even what is initially encountered is not clearly perceived due to distance, etc.

But there may be being all-pervading in most objects, just as a clay ball is said to pervade more space in relation to another clay ball, but not to pervade everything. If it is the limit beyond which nothing is possible, there is inconstancy with the effect substances. For even those with excess, like pots, are not possible to be exceeded in size. Because of the consequence of there being no other possibility. Because everything is pervaded by one. And it is not right to say that this is a property of quality. Because heaviness and other properties of it are not possible in that state. Because all those possessing heaviness do not produce one effect. And because of the difference in effort, there is the attainment of near and far by humans, wind, deer, monkeys, and birds. And there is no excess of it that is not possible to be exceeded.

Is it not the state of being unconditioned? But this is only the absence of dimension. Then, is this much the dimension? And by saying that the knowledge of God reaches such a limit, He reveals ignorance. This is the appearance of a vampire in the rite of peace. Then, omniscience follows only from being the agent of all actions. For potters and others are agents only when they know the material, the tools, the recipient, and the purpose. And since God is the agent of all actions, He knows the material and so on of all actions. And thus He is omniscient. Do they know all the tools of their own action or only some of the tools? They do not know all the tools, because they do not know the unseen. Nor do they know the recipient and the specific purpose, because that is possible in many ways. The knowledge of that alone does not establish omniscience. And children, lunatics, etc. do not know the purpose, etc. of all actions.

If it is possible, then the inference of that [soul] is not from the arrangement. Or if it is preceded by the latent impression of action, the knowledge of that [soul] may be from another [source]. But isn't the inference of that [soul] just from the absence of the cause, as the effect is absent? Otherwise, even the criticism would not be possible. Or the distinction should be stated from which criticism is not a proof. It is said: Indeed, the arrangements, which are different from perception and are preceded by non-perception, would not have that [soul] as their cause. And the intellect is not to be inferred in that way. Because of the inference from the similarity of what is seen. Moreover, even if there is equality, criticism is from the mere connection, and the proof is also. But the proof is when the opponent is refuted, in the establishment of the probandum.

And that, like that, is seen in the world as the fourth, which consists of instigation. For thus, commands and requests engage the person to be employed in the object of action, disregarding the result desired by him, for the sake of the employer. But instruction is for the sake of the person to be employed. As for permission, although it is sometimes like this, it is not instruction because it pertains to a person who is already engaged. The wise call instruction the engagement of an unengaged person in the object of action for the sake of the person to be employed. For there is no understanding of instruction in the words Go to the cow, Teach the boy, Do as you please. Nor is there understanding of a command etc. in the words One should go on alms round, One who is feverish should eat wholesome food. And this, for the most part, is seen in the world as not mixed with commands etc. in the human works such as the science of desire, etc. And in the words of a cowherd etc. which are about the narration of a path, in the words Go by this path.

Otherwise, all words would be distinguished from other words, and there would be no distinction at all. Therefore, there is no engagement for one who does not know the meaning. And this is for the purpose of demonstration. Therefore, the knowledge of uttering words that denote meanings and so on is called instruction by the word in the sense of the relation of action, agent, and cause, like in the case of sending and so on. For by them also, as intended, meanings and so on are indicated. Then the meaning is the motivator. True, but the word also, because it conveys that. Then how is the instruction of the subsidiary? For the meaning is required, it is the human goal. Otherwise, even a village and so on would not be so. And the favor of the means of instruction that is required is indicated. But from the optative ending and so on, engagement is understood. And this is refuted by others: Instruction is the action of the one to be engaged, not the instigation of one who has not started.

For no one engages in an action without understanding that it is to be done. Even the engagement in action through commands and such must somehow rely on the required basis, otherwise it would not exist. But isn't engagement in action due to the understanding that it is to be done? For how could one who understands that not engage in action? For who could give an answer to one who, having perceived gold, says it is earth? And what is the meaning of to be done? Nothing at all. It is a mere idea. And what is this idea? It is the cognition that is favorable to the understanding of an action delimited by a specific means. For the understanding of an action would be in relation to the action, and that is the cause of engagement. An invalid cognition is not a factor in practical affairs, for doubt and error are like that. For there is no engagement in the form this is to be done in this way by this means, when the means is not understood.

Even when the power of the previous cognition is not clearly remembered due to lack of reflection, the manifestation that arises appears to have a connection, because it serves that purpose. In the absence of a connection, it would not exist. And in the case of birds whose differences are based on the peculiarities of their voices, which are difficult to know even for the wise, the manifestation that occurs is the basis for activity, based on the prior learning of the sound, not the knowledge of the means. Because there is no prior instruction or repeated observation. And the understanding of the special food would not be based on the initial knowledge, because it is not known as a means of pleasure for those of the same kind. And the activity in swimming and other actions of those whose manifestations are distinguished by different species would be motivated by passion, etc., for those of the same species who do not know the means. And the activity of those who are in eternal conflict would be motivated by hatred. Therefore, the mere known means is not the cause of activity, but rather the manifestation.

For the nature of Brahman is not the object of knowledge conveyed by words. For words characterized by sentences are a means of knowledge, and their object is the nature of the relation between the meanings of words. And the true nature of the self is where all distinctions and elaborations have disappeared. How can that be the object of this [knowledge]? Therefore, a different kind of knowledge is enjoined, which is distinct from the knowledge arising from words, which has as its nature the manifestation of the truth of non-duality, where all distinctions are dissolved.

Indeed, the result is not the domain of injunction. And the manifestation of the non-discursive true nature of the self is itself the result, nothing else is desired beyond that. If it is said to be liberation, then because it is not different from that, the manifestation of the discursive true nature of the self is indeed worldly existence, and the manifestation of the non-discursive true nature of the self is indeed liberation, abiding in one's own nature. Otherwise, because it would be an effect, it would not be liberation. And the cause of bondage is the discursive activity such as action, etc., which is ignorance. And the destruction of that is indeed knowledge itself. And if Brahman is not the object of verbal knowledge in any way, how can the injunction to know it be understood? And knowledge is defined in relation to an object. And it defines that which is established. And its establishment would be due to the absence of any other means of knowledge. And if that also has no object, then due to its non-establishment, the non-understanding of the particular knowledge, there is no understanding of the injunction. But if it is somehow an object, then it is not independent of verbal knowledge. And because the statement has the nature of what is to be accomplished by understanding, it is not a means of knowledge.

For thus, because the result is always desired, it is truly to be done by its power. But the word merely indicates the knowledge of the means always desired. There, in the absence of the operation of the word, there would be the undesirable consequence of the performance of all parts like the expiation for the sake of removing the purpose from that, because there would be no result otherwise. For, in the case of eternality by the word, it is impossible to say as much as one can because the parts are complete and it is always. Otherwise, because the enunciation of the parts is not optional, it would be like the Viśvajit etc. that he who is such and such is entitled. For, the disabled etc. are not entitled to the Viśvajit, which is the means of the desired result for all. The desired is not incidental. Because there is no evidence. And because the fault is removed even by the fault of non-performance by presumption. And because the assumption itself is proper by the Smṛti and the supplementary passages.

In pleasure or its cause, there may be indifference at times. But for one who is always averse to pain and its causes, there is always a desire for their cessation. And for one who seeks even what is beneficial, there is certainly an effort when the obstruction is destroyed. Therefore, the destruction of sin, which is based on what is desired, is always desired. And because the fruits of obligatory rites are eternal, it is understood from the word 'as long as one lives' that it is eternal. Thus there is no contradiction with eternality. For if the object to be accomplished were non-eternal, that would be contradicted. And the performance according to one's ability is due to eternality itself, because the rite without deficient limbs is always possible. And this is not real eternality.

Just as the life-long injunction is not capable of being performed in its entirety, so also the act that is subsidiary to the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa cannot be performed in its entirety by one who is desirous of going to heaven. So that, in this case also, the performance of as much as one can of the principal act and of its subsidiaries would be quite possible.

Or, the term ‘nitya,’ ‘essential,’ may be taken as connoting importance; and the sense of the argument in that case would be that the omission of details is permissible in the case of the important acts, and not of the unimportant ones; e.g., the Upanayana has been enjoined as essential (important), and in connection with this, it has been laid down that ‘the time for it is prior to the sixteenth year,’ and again ‘one should not allow the Āśramakṛtya (Dharma) to become impaired’; and in regard to this latter, it is pointed out that ‘there is impairment of the duties of the life-stages, if one passes the period (of studentship) without having gone through the rite (of Upanayana).’ From all this it would seem that the passing of the prescribed time would render the man inadmissible to Upanayana; but in reality, even though a hundred years old, the man is still entitled to the Upanayana, for the simple reason that the Upanayana is an obligatory (essential) act.

Because the injunction to perform as long as one lives has no other course. There, the injunction of desire for heaven is indeed appropriate even in what is capable of including all the subsidiary rites, because there is no contradiction there. Like the rule about eating from a bronze vessel, the operation of the subsidiary rites is in accordance with that, in order to comply with it. True, the contradiction characterized by the contraction of the scope of the injunction of desire for heaven has been shown without contradiction. In that case, in the contradiction of the non-primary, compliance with the primary is better, like in the world. Just as when it is said to feed the Brahmins with food of various utensils, the rule about the Brahmins is in accordance with the arrangement of the utensils according to ability, in the same way, the injunctions of the subsidiary rites are also not absolutely dependent. Therefore, even in the optional rites, it should be just as one is able, not that one should do what one is able at that time. Because there is no difference. This is not the essence.

Because the performance is dependent on the entitlement. And there is no application even in the case of a desired result, because the entitlement to the desired result ends with the completion of the result, and the occasional ends with the completion of the performance, and because the result depends on the means. And as long as the means is understood, the result is accomplished only by the combination of all the parts. But in both cases, the entitlement must be performed. True, in one case it ends with the occasion, in the other with the result. There, in the case ending with the occasion, for one who is entitled due to having the occasion, if he does not perform, his entitlement is transgressed, so the performance is according to the impossibility. But in the case ending with the result, if there is a deficiency of parts, the result does not arise. The desire for the result, which is the cause of entitlement, ceases. Due to the absence of entitlement, there is no transgression of entitlement.

Let you explain this limb: Is the qualification dependent on ability, and the performance according to the qualification, or is the qualification dependent on the Vedic text, and the performance according to one's ability for one who is qualified? In the former case, just as in an action connected with a specific time, only one who lives at that time is qualified, because it is not possible for another to perform that action with its specific time, otherwise, even at another time, one who does not perform would transgress the qualification. But in the latter case, the ability of the limb does not distinguish the qualification, so there is the undesirable consequence of continuity. We do not say that the ability of the limb distinguishes the qualification. Rather, the qualification itself is dependent on the ability of the limb. But when such a particular limb is not possible, the performance does not cease. And it has been said that due to the defect, there is no cause of qualification even in the result.

It is the inability to conclude that. Then he is not entitled, because that is a qualification of him. If it is non-conclusion, it is only non-auxiliary nature. Occasional inability is impossibility, not by that is there preclusion of entitlement, like deficiency of an auxiliary that cannot be remedied by a substance. True, he is not like a Shudra, but when the cause of entitlement is absent, entitlement does not cease, like the desire for fruit in one who has lost desire. Otherwise, for one who is entitled, who is able, who desires heaven, if the fruit does not arise due to occasional deficiency of the power of the auxiliaries, there would be transgression of entitlement, and for one who does not perform what is not yet due.

Even if the proper time has arrived, he would be so by requiring the completeness of the other limbs. Or if the life limited by the limb-part time is the cause of qualification, it is the same even in other limbs. Moreover, is one who is qualified with complete limbs to employ one deficient in limbs? If it is said that it is impossible, it is not so, because of the submergence of three assumptions. Thus, either there is no employment of the injunction due to the requirement of the action up to the end, or due to the non-fulfillment of the qualification, or due to the conformity with the teaching of the additional limbs as far as possible. When such is possible, then due to the favor of both, it is proper that it should be like the sacrifice for one who has begotten a son, because the immediacy of the occasion is not the meaning of the word. Or like time, there is no employment due to the limitation of qualification by the power of the limb. And that very injunction is both the employer and the non-employer of them. But

He cannot be regarded as entitled to the performance of that kind. Therefore, for one who is capable, the understanding of the entitlement depends on the teaching of the necessary capacity. And this understanding of entitlement ends there, because capacity is not permanent. Otherwise, if one who is entitled does not complete all the parts of the rite, there would be no performance according to capacity. Otherwise, due to entitlement to a different kind of performance, the performance of that kind would not be enjoined, because of lack of entitlement. Therefore, again, there is a need for capacity for the conclusion of the understanding of entitlement. For capacity is said to be a part of the means of knowledge, not for the ascertainment of the performance, because that is not known by any other means. It may be resorted to either in time or in parts. If resorted to in parts, there would be contradiction with the words due to the omission of other parts understood from the words. But if in time, since other times are not the meaning of the words, there is no contradiction.

Nor is it ever the means of harm. Therefore it is understood that the rite is always the desired means, as far as possible, included in its parts.

Because there is no contradiction due to the connection with 'when one is able' in the injunction for one who desires heaven even while alive. And because the sequence is required, there is no omission of auxiliaries. Therefore, just as life is not a qualification of the agent because of the inexpressibility due to the non-connection of the meaning of the two 'yāvat's', and just as the connection with the time is not for the sake of spring in 'in spring, in spring', so also it is not a qualification of the injunction.

For that would not be the cause at all if it were not performed when that exists. And since the injunction has a cause, it is established that it belongs to a particular person. Therefore, the cause, though existing, is a qualifier of the person, not the person, though existing, is a qualifier of the cause. And because the nature of the cause is verbal, the inflexions etc. indicate it, as is remembered here and there in the Smriti he should burn when the vessel is broken. There, it is not proper to abandon the meaning of the word and take the word as referring to something else by the power of the word, while the other refers to it by the power of the meaning. And just as the cause, though existing, is a qualifier of the person, so the result, though existing, is a qualifier of the person, not the person, though existing, is a qualifier of the result. This has been stated in the Bhavana Viveka.
['SA_GSP33_vidhivi-531']		Ro	The non-connection of those two is this: If, when that exists, it is not performed, then that would not be the cause at all. And the injunction is for one who has the cause, so there is no non-understanding due to the establishment of a particular person entitled. Therefore, the cause, though existing, is a qualifier of the particular person entitled, not a qualifier of the particular person entitled, though existing, is the cause. And because the state of being a cause is based on the word, the gender endings etc. indicate that, as stated in various Smritis like he should burn when the sacrifice is interrupted. There, it is not proper to abandon the meaning of the word and follow the operation of the word that it refers to something else based on the word's power, while the other refers to that based on the meaning. And just as the cause, though existing, is a qualifier of the particular person entitled, so the result, though existing, is a qualifier of the particular person entitled, not a qualifier of the particular person entitled, though existing, is the result, as stated in the Bhāvanāviveka.

And thus, due to mutual independence, even in proximity, there is no repetition by the result. So there would be a difference in the action in all cases. And it would not be for the purpose of the sacrifice. And in he offers with curd, there would be no connection between the quality and the result. And nothing else is desired like happiness. And that is heaven. Due to the restriction to heaven, the opportunity for animals etc. is difficult to obtain. Or they would be due to the mention. But heaven would be eternal. Therefore, what remains for the bhāvanā? The qualification is only the human goal. And even so, in the cause, only the action is to be accomplished. Otherwise, there would be a split of the sentence in the adoptable cause and result. Due to the difference, the offering is by the living, the result is by the offering. Due to the impossibility of a single sentence for two objects. For from one, the destruction of misfortune and the loss in non-action are not easily obtained. And thus, due to being known, the form of the action is indeed not a subsidiary.

Otherwise, there would be no cause for engagement, either from oneself or from another, because even in the means to what is desired, which is not required for action, there is no engagement. As it is said, the result of the scripture belongs to the performer, because that is the definition of the scripture. Because the scripture is defined by the means to the result of the performer.

The consideration of what is the motivator and what is not the motivator is also determined by the extent of the operation of the injunction of the performance of the sacrifice.

Therefore, the Arthavada is for the sake of the sacrifice, and the injunction of the result is for the sake of the person. And even though the performance is dependent on the injunction, the fact that the quality of being made of parna-leaves is not the object of the injunction of the performance of the sacrifice makes it for the sake of the person. And the extent of its operation has been considered in the same way. But in the principal act, even though the activity is dependent on the injunction, it is for the sake of the person simply because it is in the form of a general rule, while the activity in the form of a particular rule is for the sake of the sacrifice. However, the dependence on the subsidiaries is subsequent to the knowledge of the means. That knowledge is the injunction of that.

There, just as the means to the desired end is the cause of engagement, not anything else, so also capability. And capability, entering into the form of the injunction which is the nature of engagement, is understood from the scriptures as the means to the desired end. And thus, the means to the desired end belongs to one who is a seeker. And the capable action, known from the scriptures, is determined as far as possible without contradiction by other means of knowledge. Thus, it is said that all are eligible.

For they say that an action is to be accomplished, while a substance is naturally existent, and a quality is subordinate. Thus they consider that the result is not connected with the sentence. And thus, in the absence of a result, there is no occasion for the injunction. For in actions that do not have a result, no one is to be enjoined, nor is there an owner. How then is the result not connected? Because of the cognition of the action as to be accomplished, and because two things to be accomplished cannot be combined. For thus: if the actions such as sacrifice are themselves understood in the form of the principal, being prior and posterior, or if there is an action different from them, and that has an object and is principal in the sense of being to be accomplished, then also they are the same. Why? Because of the rule of priority and posteriority. Because the suffix expresses its own meaning connected with the meaning of the root, and is cognized as to be accomplished. Otherwise, because of the non-distinction of words for substance and quality, and because of the acceptance of those in the origination, as in by the wood he cooks.

And in reality, there is no connection by way of being fruits. Because human effort has sacrifice etc. as its object, and because heaven etc. are not connected, and because no other operation of sacrifice etc. is seen, it is not possible for them to be instruments. Because the elements are not active. And because it is possible, it is not proper to say one should make heaven by human effort. And because it would lead to the undesirable consequence that it must be done. And because the result is accepted as not to be enjoined, and because sacrifice etc. are relied upon as to be enjoined. For the injunction is not directly on the sacrifice or the result, but on the sphere of activity. And activity is the bhāvanā. And the word that is the cause of the activity whose object is that is said to be the injunction. There, the bhāvanā that is to be enjoined does not exist at all, because it is mentioned by the verb.

Even if there were presumption, because of the purpose of accomplishment, there would be no blindness in the form of the agent. How then is there an injunction now? What is the matter here? Injunction is mere instigation, it does not touch human goals or means. Why? Because of the invariable concomitance of the cognition. And thus, from words ending in lin and so on, there is the understanding of instigation. And although the means of accomplishing what is to be done is the cause of engagement, the word, not apprehending that form, ascertains only the cause of engagement. Because of the understanding of its form, and because of the absence of that in commands and so on. And because mere instigation is invariably concomitant. And because of the fault of having multiple meanings. And the understanding of that is not from the understanding of that form alone. Because of delusion and so on.

What follows from this? It is understood that the one who desires is entitled. Indeed, but not the establishment of engagement in the absence of a result. And the title is for the purpose of engagement. But thus the teaching would be pointless. When there is a purpose, it is not pointless. But when there is no purpose, what else can it be? Or it is not pointless because its purpose is the establishment of the title to know the self. Indeed, this person, naturally possessed by passion etc., engaged in acquiring objects with visible results, is attached to that attainment, and is not capable of understanding or contemplating the truth of the self, which is free from the proliferation of objects, even if taught. But instructed by teachings about actions, having destroyed the desires that are made, he turns away from natural engagement.

Therefore, that alone is not the meaning of the word. Rather, agency, like the words 'tṛn' etc., is connected with a specific meaning, because otherwise there would be the consequence of the usage and understanding of the agent. Nor are the limiting conditions not the meaning of the word. Because uncognized things do not distinguish, and because there is no other cause of cognition. Because of the recollection that this word with the same sound is to be expressed by that, because of the ending in that.

Because a general injunction is subordinate to a specific one, only a specific one should be taught. And that is any one, all, or only some. In any case, the understanding of the general is meaningful by the disappearance of the specific. There, the causes of engagement, which are the sending, requesting, and permission of those who do not depend on the desired power and those who depend on it, which follow only the intention, are not to be taught for that which does not arise from the mind of a person. Delusion and so on are not, because they contradict understanding. For those, when taught, are not causes of engagement, so the understanding of engagement would be obstructed by the teaching of delusion. It would be just the opposite. Desirability is not in the action, because of contradiction with perception. And if it does not convey even the desirability of the means, it would be just non-teaching.

And thus, even though heaven etc. are established, they are connected as the result of that action, by the connection with the performer, like cooked rice etc., only as what is to be accomplished by the injunction, not otherwise. That has been stated: And because of the connection with each object. The human activity is connected with what is desired, in the sense of being directed towards it. Therefore, because of the appropriateness of desire, heaven etc. are connected as the result of that action. Otherwise, there would be no connection. Therefore, because of the mere statement one should sacrifice, since heaven etc. are dependent on the result, they are connected in that way, because otherwise there would be no coherence. And thus, from the connection, the action is understood as the means to heaven. But how is there a connection of heaven, which is a qualifier of something else, with the injunction? Or if there is a connection with that, how is it a qualifier of something else, or a compound? For the connection with that does not have the connection with something else, nor does it depend on the connection with the injunction. The quality is

Heaven is not related to the injunction independently of one desiring heaven, but rather that very [heaven] becomes the principal qualifier in the relationship, just as in the stick-holder recites the Praisa, the stick-holder is principal, and the stick related to it is not intended as its own nature. And thus the compound is also appropriate. For if an independent [word] were related to something else, that [compound] would not be possible because of its dependence. But when there is a relationship with something else through that [qualifier], there is no contradiction in the absence of a single meaning, so the compound is appropriate. Otherwise, all compounds of qualifiers would be so, because if they do not touch the effect, they are useless. If they do touch [the effect], then because of dependence, the compound would occur.

Even in the case of the meaning of the verbal root, if the bhāvanā is to be accomplished by implication, that is refuted by the injunction [of the bhāvanā]. If it is merely being the object of the bhāvanā, that is common to other causes as well. For it has been said: The instrument is indeed the sphere of activity of the agent in all cases. And because the accomplished [object] is the means, due to having the nature of being the meaning of words denoting substance and quality. Because there is no appropriation of what is already accomplished. Because the sacrifice and so on, which delights the bhāvanā by the Vedic text itself, is understood as its qualifier. The twofold nature is created by the presence or absence of the unseen [result]. The fact that human effort is not the object of the sacrifice is not contradictory even in heaven. And like an axe in what is to be cut, [human effort] is the object of the axe. And the sacrifice and so on are not non-actions. That is understood from the word itself. And the arising of the lamps of knowledge is also accepted as an action.
