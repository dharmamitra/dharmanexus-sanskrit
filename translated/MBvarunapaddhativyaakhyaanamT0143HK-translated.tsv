Thus, the limiting adjunct is one,🔽the isolation of consciousness, and the other is called liberation in the initiation without a base.

Even that is not possible as the highest good, because it does not transcend the state of enjoyment.
['MBvarunapaddhativyaakhyaanamT0143HK-54']	anyepunarāhuḥ yonidvaividhyādi kramānnirvāṇadvayaṃ iti /	anye punar āhuḥ yoni dvaividhya ādi kramāt nirvāṇa dvayam iti 	Others again say that there are two kinds of birth, and therefore two kinds of liberation in sequence.

This is heard: One abides in the birth of the womb. Therefore,

After that, since there is no more birth for the person, the birth of the universal substratum also ceases, and there is manifestation as Śiva.🔽Thus, liberation is of two kinds, higher and lower, due to the difference in states. That is also incorrect.
['MBvarunapaddhativyaakhyaanamT0143HK-61']	dūṣaṇānativṛttaṃ bhuktyanati vṛtteḥ / evaṃ	dūṣaṇa anativṛttam bhukti anati vṛtteḥ evam 	Because it does not transcend the faults, and because it does not transcend enjoyment. In the same way,

Thus it is established. Now, in accordance with the order of the exposition,
