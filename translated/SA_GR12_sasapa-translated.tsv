This very examination is the consideration of whether this is reasonable or not. And that is reasonable only if the teaching is true, because there is dispute only there, like the reliability of the speaker, but not merely because of being a teaching, like mere speakership.

And none of these doctrines are true, because they contradict each other in teaching the existence and non-existence of duality and non-duality. And it should not be concluded that nothing is true there, because when two things are mutually contradictory like light and darkness, it is not possible to negate one and affirm the other, and therefore one of them must be affirmed as true, because one must necessarily accept something as true.

For this is what is called the truth of the teaching of truth, namely, that it is not contrary to what is seen and desired. Even if what is contrary to the means of knowledge such as perception and inference were true, nothing in the world would be false. And if what is not contrary to them were false, nothing would be true. Therefore, this definition of truth is seen to be faultless, being free from over-extension, under-extension, impossibility, and inconsistency.

In this case, the cognition of the particular action is one, born of its own tendencies, and the cognition of the particular object is another, in the form of Perception; and they are not one and the same; as in that case, there would be absence of the diversity of tendencies which are the cause of the said cognitions. Just as in the waking state, so in the dream also, the man, who consists of several potencies, has the diversity of the appearance of the particular actions and objects. For instance, for the Sāṃkhyas, the one Primordial Substance, which is of one uniform character, is the substratum of the diverse appearances of the particular actions and objects; and for the followers of the doctrine of ‘No-soul’, the Soul is the substratum of the said appearances. For the followers of the doctrine of ‘Non-duality’, the one ‘Brahman’ is the substratum of the said appearances.

Therefore, in the absence of all refuting factors, how can this difference, well known through non-erroneous perception, not contradict non-duality? Because of the mutual contradiction between them. If it be said that therefore non-duality would contradict difference, it is not so; because non-duality is accepted only as a matter of convention, and because the absence of a proof establishing it has already been stated before, and because difference is established by a proof, and because perception apprehending it has been proved to be non-erroneous in the absence of a refuting factor. For, no one can contradict the difference of action and factors, established by a proof, merely by an acceptance, like the acceptance of momentariness. Thus, in the absence of all refuting factors, the difference of action and factors, well known through non-erroneous perception, is contradicted in the doctrine of absolute non-duality. Therefore, it is established that the teaching of the non-duality of the supreme Brahman is for the purpose of the realization of the Self, which is the supreme goal of human life.

Because Brahman cannot be established by any means of valid knowledge. Otherwise, there would be the undesirable consequence of the duality of means of valid knowledge and objects of valid knowledge. If it is established by a mistaken means of valid knowledge, then there would be the undesirable consequence of the establishment of the ultimate fire, etc., by the smoke perceived in a dream. Because the reflection is ultimately real itself, as it is a modification of the water-pudgala due to the specific proximity of the rays of the moon. If the non-duality of Brahman is established by a mistaken means of valid knowledge or without any means of valid knowledge, then the establishment of non-self, non-duality, etc. would also be irrepressible. Thus, due to the absence of refutation and proof regarding non-duality and duality, the Vedāntins would abandon their own view.

Or if the world is non-existent like a barren woman's son, then how does it itself come within the path of cognition through the notion of 'I'? Let the opponent clearly state this. If it is said that it is so due to ignorance, that is not so, because ignorance itself, whose nature has been described by others, cannot be established, because it does not transcend conceptualization. If ignorance is non-existent, it cannot be the cause of false cognition. Because it is established that only an existent thing with unseen faults, such as impressions, spells, and tantras, is the cause of false cognitions in dreams, magic, etc. If it has an existent nature, the establishment of duality is entailed. If ignorance is inexpressible as either existent or non-existent, how can it be said that ignorance exists in the state of worldly existence, because worldly existence is the manifestation of ignorance, but does not exist in the state of liberation, because liberation is of the nature of the cessation of ignorance?

The argument is as follows: Whatever has the form of the object of knowledge and the knower, all that is erroneous, like the knowledge in a dream, magic, etc. And perception etc. are like that. Indeed, erroneous perception etc. are not the establishers of external objects. Because it would lead to the consequence that even the perception in a dream etc. would be the establishers of objects. Thus, external objects, which are not logically possible, should not be believed even though seen.

Because consciousness, being momentary, non-cognisable by anything else, and having multiple continua, cannot be known by itself like the supreme Brahman, because otherwise, even the existence of Brahman would be undeniable.

Just as in the state of waking, due to the extreme firmness of the impression of external objects, there is the belief in the truth of knowledge with that form, but in the state of dream etc., due to the lack of firmness of that impression, there is the belief in the untruth of that experience, so in the state free from delusion, due to the extreme firmness of the impression of the knowledge of another continuum, there is the belief in truth, but elsewhere, due to its lack of firmness, there is the practice of untruth. Thus, let the difference in impressions be understood, but not another continuum. If that is not accepted, how is the establishment of the destruction of moments in one's own continuum accepted? Having gone far, some experience must be sought that relies on one's own desired truth. Therefore, this one, establishing a treatise for the understanding of others with false views, actually obstructs the knowledge of reality and the study of consciousness. Thus, nothing is said.

Their application is the demonstration. Blue etc. are not different from cognition because they are cognized by it, like its own form. etc., and Blue etc. are not inert because they appear, like pleasure etc. etc. If it is asked how this is not established if it is an external object, it is because it is a particular of that. For when that is absent, its particular cannot exist. When there is no tree, only the absence of a śimśapā is understood. If it is said that it is not a particular of that because it has an imposed form, no. Because even from that, which lacks all power, the desired is not established like the undesired. If it is said that this cognition, even though not imposed, is not an external object, no. Because of its existence for the one to whom it is taught.

Ignorance and craving, which are the causes of the origination and bondage of that suffering, are called the origin. Among them, non-understanding of the nature of reality is ignorance. Desire for the attainment and avoidance of desirable and undesirable sense objects is craving. Cessation is liberation, characterized by the arising of the undefiled mind-stream through the destruction of ignorance and craving, or characterized by the cessation of the continuum.

There, how could any other [cause of oneness] be, except for oneness due to some kind of proximity? Because proximity of place is contradicted by cold, wind, etc., because proximity of time is inconclusive with all the objects existing at the same time, because proximity of existence is inconclusive with the many cognitions of men born from a single object, only proximity of substance remains by elimination.

Here and elsewhere, everywhere, the fault of contradiction and so on sets aside the variegated cognition itself. So what is the use of certainty? Therefore, the gross form accepted by the Sāṃkhyas is established as the ultimate reality itself. By this, the common form desired by them would also be established as the ultimate reality, because the generality characterized by similar transformation accepted by the Sāṃkhyas does not deserve to be rejected. Otherwise, due to the absence of the perception of similarity in relation to silver and so on in mother-of-pearl and so on, how can the superimposition of silver and so on be based on that? Therefore, this would be well said: In mother-of-pearl, the form of silver is due to the perception of similarity in form.

Then, the same [objection] applies to the effect, which is produced only at the time when there is absence of that [cause], which is non-existent before and after the moment of the cause, and is distinguished by that absence. How can it be subject to that [cause]? If it be argued that if the eternal [cause] produces many effects at every moment, it would be established as having many natures successively, and how could it be one? The same objection applies equally to the momentary [cause]. For that entity, even if it remains for one moment, has many natures, because it has various effects, like the moments of many objects. For it is not proper that the diversity of effects should be due to anything other than the diversity of the potencies of the cause, as in the case of the cognitions of form, etc. Just as the cognitions of form, etc. in camphor, etc. are due to the diversity of the natures of form, etc., so the various effects such as burning of the wick, drying up of the oil, etc. from a single moment of a lamp, etc. which remains for a moment, are due to the diversity of potencies.

If it is argued that this is because things are established as suitable or unsuitable to be seen, what is this so-called manifestation? If it is said to be the perception of what was not previously perceived due to the activity of the manifestor, and that is either permanent or impermanent, if it is impermanent, then it would be created by causes as previously non-existent. Otherwise, it would follow that it is permanent. And in that case, a pot and so on would also be created by causes as previously non-existent. But this is not so, because it contradicts the doctrine of the existence of effects. It is argued that manifestation is created by causes as previously non-existent, but not a pot and so on.

In the absence of the ‘enjoyer’, in the shape of the Spirit, there can be no ‘enjoyment’; because the Spirit is so called because of its being the ‘enjoyer’; and if there is no ‘enjoyment’, then there can be no ‘Pradhāna’ either; because it is so called because it is the ‘cause of enjoyment’. Thus, there being no room for the existence of the ‘Pradhāna’ and the ‘Spirit’, all the categories postulated by the Sāṃkhyas become reduced to nothing; and the whole world becomes a void. Under the circumstances, how could the Sāṃkhya philosophy be accepted as established by Perception? (11) “The Sāṃkhya philosophy is found to be contrary to perceptible facts; because the earth, the mountains, the trees and other things are not found to be composed of the three postulated Attributes of Sattva and the rest.” (12) (Sāṃkhyakārikā, 12).

[we say]—because it depends on another [i.e. the soul], just like the other [i.e. the soul]. It depends on another, because it depends on the determination of the intellect, since it is said that the soul experiences the object determined by the intellect. If experience did not depend on the determination of the intellect, it would follow absurdly that the soul would experience everything everywhere at all times. And since [experience] is occasional due to its dependence on the presence of the object to be experienced, it is established that experience is impermanent. And if that [experience] is different from the soul, then it cannot be the experiencer of that [soul], just like space, or like another soul. Therefore, if experience is not different from that [soul], then it is established that the soul is somehow impermanent due to having that [experience] as its nature. Thus this argument successfully establishes the impermanence of the self. Therefore it is well said that the Sāṃkhya view is contrary to what is desired.

Even in the absence of that difference, by the example of existence, only inherence would have self-manifestation, but not knowledge has self-awareness. Therefore, the mere display of a doctrine composed out of one's own liking, like self-connection, in the case of self-awareness also, there is no contradiction in the action being with respect to itself, otherwise, in that case also, it would follow.

Because in that case, the direction etc. also would have to be regarded as subsisting, because the knowledge of direction etc. is possible only when the corporeal substances are present, and is impossible when the space devoid of the corporeal substances is present.

The argument may be formulated as follows: Inherence cannot be a Relation, because it is not dependent upon anything else, like Ākāśa; and Inherence is not dependent upon anything else; hence there is apprehension of something contrary to what is wider (than the reason adduced).

Because the relation of inherence is established by a valid means of knowledge, and the relation of inherence is understood to be characterized by non-deviation.

When the opponent accepts the pervaded, the establishment of the acceptance of the pervader as an invariable concomitant is demonstrated. Because dependence is not pervaded by non-relation, as it is not established in space etc. Nor is it inconclusive, because the relation of something independent is not known, and it does not occur in the contrary.

In their absence, the four kinds of atoms which are their causes are also not possible, because the effect is the mark of the cause. The delusion of atoms is the delusion of the effect, because it is said that the cause is the mark of the effect. Similarly, in the absence of the four elements, due to the absence of the notions of superior, inferior, etc., and the notions of this, that, prior, etc., time and space are not established. Similarly, due to the absence of the conjunction of space with the drum, stick, etc., the sound produced by conjunction does not arise. And due to the impossibility of the disjunction of parts everywhere in the absence of the conjunction of parts, the sound produced by disjunction also does not arise. And due to their non-occurrence, the sound produced by sound is not possible. Thus, due to the absence of the means of establishing space by the non-production of all sound, there is the loss of space.

For thus, when a dispute has arisen, the followers of Yoga establish the creation of the world by Mahesvara by the inference, The body, senses, and worlds etc. have an intelligent cause, because they are effects, like a pot etc. And that is contradicted by inference, because there is an inference that contradicts it. And that is this: God is not the maker of the body etc., because he is bodiless. One who is so is thus. Like the self. And this is so. Therefore, it is just so. And the reason is not unestablished here, because it is not suitable for him to have a body. Because a body of his, which is composed of parts, cannot be established as eternal. Even if the eternal body of his is preceded by an intelligent cause, the reasons such as being an effect etc. are fallacious.

Because that is not possible even for intelligence, etc. God does not possess the triad of knowledge, desire and effort, because He is bodiless, like a liberated soul.

The eight limbs of that yoga are: yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, and samadhi. Among them, the yamas are the causes of pure conduct for a man, such as non-violence, celibacy, non-stealing, etc., which are impermanent due to place, time, and condition. The niyamas are the specific virtues that are dependent on place, time, and condition and are the causes of merit, such as worship of gods, circumambulation, evening worship, japa, etc. The asana is the posture such as padma, svastika, etc., which is to be practiced gradually in the form of recaka, pūraka, and kumbhaka, for the purpose of conquering the difficulties that obstruct the actions of yoga. Pratyāhāra is the complete withdrawal of the mind from the opposites of concentration. Dhāraṇā is the association of the mind with a particular place. Ekāgratā (one-pointedness) in that is dhyāna (meditation). Due to the excellence of dhyāna, the state of the lamp becomes free from wind and steady.

But that is contrary to perception, because a universal characterized by similar transformations is perceived to be non-eternal, not all-pervading, and having many forms like color, etc. For a universal is not perceived as one by perception in different individual forms like bamboo in a pillar, etc. It could be perceived as non-arisen and non-perishing even when the individual arises and perishes. This universal, whose nature is stated by others, does not support itself in the cognition of perception, and it wishes to be accepted as perceptible.

First, its existence in another individual is not due to going, because it is accepted to be without action. Moreover, would it go there by abandoning the previous individual or without abandoning it? Not by abandoning it, because it would follow that the previously abandoned individual cow would have the form of a non-cow. Nor without abandoning it, because for the unabandoned individual, which is partless like form, etc., going is impossible.
