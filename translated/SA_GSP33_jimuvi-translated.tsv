Otherwise there would be contradiction with experience. For the cessation of being a living being and so on, like the cessation of ignorance, is indeed experienced. Therefore, the liberation of the bodyless, characterized by the absence of a future body, is simultaneous with knowledge. And in that way, the statement of Yajnavalkya is heard:

But if it is said that knowledge, like fire obstructed by mantras etc., is obstructed by prārabdha [karman], and will give liberation from the body later, that is not so.
