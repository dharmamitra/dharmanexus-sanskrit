['MBkaalahastiisavilaasaHK-14']	tathāpi yasmādbrahma di pariṇāma pitṛtvā yogāt / dehādi	tathā api yasmāt brahma 	Nevertheless, because Brahman is the cause of transformation through the yoga of fatherhood,

['MBkaalahastiisavilaasaHK-21']	teṣā vileśa / yogeneśvara pada prayogasyeva /	teṣām 	Their meaning is subtle, like the usage of the word lord in yoga.
['MBkaalahastiisavilaasaHK-22']	tasmānnārāyaṇe mukhyaṃ brahmapadaṃ anyatra āma padaṃ	tasmāt nārāyaṇe mukhyam brahma padam anyatra padam 	Therefore, the word Brahman primarily refers to Narayana, and elsewhere it is a secondary meaning.

['MBkaalahastiisavilaasaHK-31']	tannirvacana vaiyarthyā atrocyate / yadyapi brahmapadaṃ	                    	The explanation of that is purposeless. Although the word Brahman
['MBkaalahastiisavilaasaHK-32']	bhagavatpada dṛṣṭāntena viṣṇaumukhyatvena rthānugamasya	               	is established as referring primarily to Vishnu by the example of the word Lord,

Not so, because of contradiction with the Nirukta which teaches the meaning of words. Otherwise, the word 'iri' would have multiple meanings.🔽And creation as the primary thing belongs to Vishnu.

['MBkaalahastiisavilaasaHK-40']	smṛtaḥ / atra parameśvaraśabdā dha ya saṃkoca	smṛtaḥ atra parameśvara śabdāḥ saṃkoca 	Here, the word 'Supreme Lord' is used. Since it speaks of being agitated in the form of contraction,

['MBkaalahastiisavilaasaHK-43']	virodhaḥ / tasyāvatāra hma jaganmayaḥ /	virodhaḥ tasya avatāra           jagat mayaḥ 	There is no contradiction because it teaches the intermediate creation done by Narayana. He is an incarnation of Vishnu, the universe,

Because it is a human composition, the meaning of the Vedas, which is

And because it is stated that even an uncultured usage is useful in deciding the meaning of sentences like One should sacrifice a cuckoo.

In the case of the word Brahman, there is no such contradiction. If it is argued that there is no basis for usage in the word Brahman,

The syllable Om, which is obtained as the means of meditation on that [Rudra], is indicated by the word Brahman, which is superimposed as the designation of Brahman, in order to praise it. Thus, the word Brahman is primary in Rudra, and by the superimposition of non-difference, it is also primary in the syllable Om. Otherwise, the word Hari would also be secondary in a frog, a conch, a deer, etc. Inference is also improper, because if it proves primacy in Vishnu, it proves what is already established.
