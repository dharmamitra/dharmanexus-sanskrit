['MBIPVV_3_hk-35', 'MBIPVV_3_hk-36']	ata eva yadapyuktam/🔽ityādinā	atas eva yat api uktam  ityādinā 	Therefore, it is also said:
['MBIPVV_3_hk-37']	tathā vijñātṛvijñeyabhedo yadavabhāsyate /	tathā vijñātṛ vijñeya bhedaḥ yat avabhāsyate 	Thus, the difference between the knower and the known that is manifested,

Thus, one [verse] refutes the previously stated opponent's position. One [verse] distinguishes sequence from non-sequence. Three [verses] describe the nature of sequence. Two [verses] divide the domain of sequence and non-sequence. Even with the division of the domain,

Thus, in one verse, the previously stated objection is refuted. In one verse, the distinction between having sequence and not having sequence is made. In three verses, the nature of sequence is described. In two verses, the division of the objects of having sequence and not having sequence is made. Even in the division of objects, their ultimate resting is in one place only, as stated in the verse. This is the meaning of the chapter.

Now, even the other topics of inquiry are established by the reasoning useful for determining the principle of the power of knowledge, in the manner of the conclusion of the section.
['MBIPVV_3_hk-45']	iti sūtram	iti sūtram 	Thus is the aphorism.
['MBIPVV_3_hk-46']	ata eva yadapyuktaṃ kriyā naikasya sakramā /	atas eva yat api uktam kriyā nā ekasya sakramā 	For this very reason, what was said - that action is not sequential for one,

The word api (also) means that the criticism is not only about the object of knowledge, but also about the object of action. Thus,

And how can there be a single nature of the substratum when it is connected with that? And how can the relation, which is twofold, etc., be a single form?
