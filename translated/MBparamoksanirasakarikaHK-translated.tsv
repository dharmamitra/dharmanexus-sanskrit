It has been argued (under Text 219) that “before birth, the soul was non-existent, etc. etc.” This non-existence is not admitted; because even before birth, the soul’s knowledge, action and power are found to be manifested through the body that may serve to manifest them. Just as the soul is cognised as all-pervading, through the body that serves to manifest it, in the same manner, the existence and all-pervading character of its properties also become established. The sense is as follows: Just as the soul is well-established, so also the manifestation of its properties is brought about by the manifesting agencies, such as light and the like, in the case of the visual and other perceptions; the functioning of the sense-organs is stimulated by such things as the collyrium, etc.; the skill of the organs of action is brought about by such things as the learning of arts and crafts; and the subjugation of the mind is brought about by the practice of yoga and similar means. Thus the soul becomes endowed with the attributes of knowership and agency, in accordance with the degree of excellence of the said means.

It has been argued (under Text 2191, by Kumārila) that “prior to the state of birth, the Soul is devoid of the capacity of being all-knowing, etc.” This non-existence is not admitted; because even prior to birth, the capacity of the Soul to know and act has been found to be there, in the shape of the Body that manifests itself. Just as the Soul, wherever it is manifested by the Body, is perceived there, and is thus recognised as all-pervading, in the same way, the existence and all-pervasiveness of its properties also is well established. This is what is meant. Just as it is well known that the Soul, by the manifestation of its properties, increases its own power in the shape of knowledge and action, through such means as the manifestation of the Eye, etc. which are the cause of the manifestation of the Soul, so also is it well known that the power of the Sense-organs is increased by such means as the application of collyrium to the Eye, and the like, which bring about the manifestation of the object; and that the efficiency of the organs of action is brought about by such means as the learning of arts and crafts, etc.; and that the mind is brought under control by such means as the practice of Yoga, etc.; and that the power of the Soul in the shape of knowledge and action is increased by such means as the study of the scriptures, etc. which bring about the manifestation of the Soul.
