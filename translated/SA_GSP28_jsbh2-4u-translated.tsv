['SA_GSP28_jsbh2-4u-15']	atraca vyatirekānuvidhāna eva vidhestātparyam /	atra ca vyatireka anuvidhāne eva vidheḥ tātparyam 	And here, the purport of the injunction is only in accordance with the negative concomitance.

['SA_GSP28_jsbh2-4u-17']	karaṇe ca 'dharmeṇa pāpamapanudati' ityādivākyaśeṣāt rātrisatranyāyena pāpakṣaya evānuṣaṅgiko nityanaimittikasthale phalam /	karaṇe ca dharmeṇa pāpam apanudati ityādi vākya śeṣāt rātri satra nyāyena pāpa kṣayaḥ eva ānuṣaṅgikaḥ nitya naimittika sthale phalam 	And in case of performance, the incidental fruit in the case of obligatory and occasional acts is the destruction of sin, by implication from the supplementary passage beginning with 'Dharma removes sin', by the principle of the night-long sacrifice.

['SA_GSP28_jsbh2-4u-22']	iti prathamaṃ yāvajjīvanimittatādhikaraṇam //	iti prathamam yāvajjīva nimitta tā adhikaraṇam 	Thus ends the first chapter on the purpose of 'as long as one lives'.
