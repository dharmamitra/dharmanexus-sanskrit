['MBnatyasatrav1HK-50']	bhagavāṃstvānandanirbharatayā krīḍāśīlaḥ sandhyādau nṛtyatīti nāṭye	bhagavān tu ānanda nirbhara tayā krīḍā śīlaḥ sandhyā ādau nṛtyati iti nāṭye 	The Lord, being full of bliss, is of playful nature, dancing at dawn and other times, and thus

['MBnatyasatrav1HK-55']	namaskārahetunirūpaṇasyānucitatvādasat /	namaskāra hetu nirūpaṇasya anucita tvāt asat 	It is not proper to describe the reason for salutation, so it is not correct.
['MBnatyasatrav1HK-56']	tasmātpraṇamanaṃ prahvībhāvaḥ kāyena vācā manasā ca / ādyaḥ śiraseti	tasmāt praṇamanam prahvī bhāvaḥ kāyena vācā manasā ca ādyaḥ śirasā iti 	Therefore, bowing is humility with body, speech, and mind. The first is shown by to the head,
['MBnatyasatrav1HK-57']	darśitaḥ / dvitīyo devāvityanena / praṇamyasya nirupapadanāmagrahaṇānaucityāt	darśitaḥ dvitīyaḥ devau iti anena praṇamyasya nirupapada nāma grahaṇa anaucityāt 	and the second by to the gods. Because it is not proper to use the name without a prefix for one to whom one bows,
['MBnatyasatrav1HK-58']	tena prathamaṃ devāvityuktam / abhineyaprādhānyācāṅgikaḥ śiraseti /	tena prathamam devau iti uktam abhineya prādhānyāt ca āṅgikaḥ śirasā iti 	therefore to the gods is said first. And because the bodily expression is primary, the bodily expression to the head is shown,
['MBnatyasatrav1HK-59']	vācikaśca devāvityādinā vākyābhinayo darśitaḥ / lokasiddho hyayamabhinayo	vācikaḥ ca devau ityādinā vākya abhinayaḥ darśitaḥ loka siddhaḥ hi ayam abhinayaḥ 	and the verbal expression to the gods and so on. For this expression is well-known in the world,

Just as four and so on are distinguished as upward and so on in the limbs, so the expression
['MBnatyasatrav1HK-61']	pradarśanīya eva / mānasī tu prahvatā vākkāyavyāpāragamyeti nāsau	pradarśanīyaḥ eva mānasī tu prahva tā vāc kāya vyāpāra gamyā iti na asau 	is also to be displayed. But mental humility is understood from the activity of speech and body, so it is not

The sequence grandfather and Maheśvara is for the sake of alliteration.🔽And to show that the expression with ornaments is a theatrical expression, and

By grandfather and Maheśvara, the gods' desire for the welfare of the world is stated.
['MBnatyasatrav1HK-67']	nāṭyaśāstramiti /	nāṭya śāstram iti 	The treatise on dramaturgy.

For that, which is in the form of an explanation, is different from the composition, like what is said by Katha.
['MBnatyasatrav1HK-72']	granthasya ca nāṭyavedatve utpattyādipañcakasya	granthasya ca nāṭya veda tve utpatti ādi pañcakasya 	And if the text is the drama Veda, then the set of five beginning with origination,

['MBnatyasatrav1HK-74']	cānupapattiḥ dṛśyaṃ śravyaṃ ca yadbhavet jagrāha pāṭhyamṛgvedāt	ca anupapattiḥ dṛśyam śravyam ca yat bhavet jagrāha pāṭhyam ṛgvedāt 	is illogical, because what is seen and heard is taken from the Rig Veda as the recitation,
['MBnatyasatrav1HK-75']	ityādergranthaṃ pratyasaṅgatvatvāt / tasmānnāṭyaṃ ca tacchāstrañca /	ityādeḥ grantham prati asaṅga tva tvāt tasmāt nāṭyam ca tat śāstram ca 	etc., because it is irrelevant to the text. Therefore, the drama and the treatise,

['MBnatyasatrav1HK-77']	nirūpayiṣya ityarthaḥ /	nirūpayiṣye iti arthaḥ 	The meaning is that I will determine it by its definition.

The drama🔽is not a Veda, because it is not a Veda.
['MBnatyasatrav1HK-79']	cāśabdātmakatvāt / nirūpaṇamātre ca pravacane granthasyāpi pravacanopapatteḥ	ca āśabda ātmaka tvāt nirūpaṇa mātre ca pravacane granthasya api pravacana upapatteḥ 	Because it is not in the form of words.

['MBnatyasatrav1HK-83']	śṛṇuyādityasyāvācakatvāt /	śṛṇuyāt iti asya avācaka tvāt 	Because of the non-denotativeness of the word śṛṇuyāt (may listen).
