['SA_GK16_visa02cu-26']	tena caitrasya gṛhamiti na bodhaḥ /	tena caitrasya gṛham iti na bodhaḥ 	Therefore, there is no understanding of the house of Caitra.

This should be understood.

['SA_GK16_visa02cu-47']	pratītītipratīteḥ paryyavasānam samāptiḥ	        	The end of the understanding is the completion of the understanding.
['SA_GK16_visa02cu-48']	tasyaḥ virahaḥ abhāvaḥ	tasyaḥ virahaḥ abhāvaḥ 	The absence of that is the lack of it.
