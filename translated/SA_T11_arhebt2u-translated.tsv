Thus the statement of that is said to be meaningful.
['SA_T11_arhebt2u-26']	na caitad yuktam /	na ca etat yuktam 	And that is not correct.
['SA_T11_arhebt2u-27']	yataḥ prekṣāvatāṃ pravṛttiḥ prayojanārthināṃ tadupāye tadbhāvaniścayāt /	yatas prekṣāvatām pravṛttiḥ prayojana arthinām tad upāye tad bhāva niścayāt 	Because the engagement of the wise who desire the purpose is in the means to that, due to the ascertainment of its existence.

['SA_T11_arhebt2u-33']	niścayaśca pramāṇādeva /	niścayaḥ ca pramāṇāt eva 	And certainty comes only from a means of valid knowledge.
['SA_T11_arhebt2u-34']	na ca prayojanavākyasya prāmāṇyamasti /	na ca prayojana vākyasya prāmāṇyam asti 	And the statement of purpose is not a means of valid knowledge.

['SA_T11_arhebt2u-37']	ṣaṃ prati upāyatāniścayaḥ samasti /	prati upāya tā niścayaḥ samasti 	Even if the statement of purpose were a means of valid knowledge in regard to intention, still, since there is no restriction on engagement in the real thing, the context cannot determine the means for a particular purpose of the statement of purpose.

Because in the world, it is seen that those with the intention to deceive express themselves in one way and act in another, there is no confidence in anything at all.
['SA_T11_arhebt2u-39', 'SA_T11_arhebt2u-40']	prayojanaviśeṣopanyāsāt prakaraṇasya tadupāyatāviṣaye saṃśayaḥ janyate tatastadbhāvanirdhāraṇāya kṛṣīvalāderiva bījādyavadhṛtaye pravṛttiryukteti 🔽cet / na /	prayojana viśeṣa upanyāsāt prakaraṇasya tad upāya tā viṣaye saṃśayaḥ janyate tatas tad bhāva nirdhāraṇāya kṛṣīvala ādeḥ iva bīja ādi avadhṛtaye pravṛttiḥ yuktā iti  ced na 	If it be said that, since a special purpose is stated, doubt is produced as to the subject-matter being the means to that, and hence, for the purpose of ascertaining that, there is proper activity, like that of the farmer, for the purpose of ascertaining the seed, etc., [we reply:] No.
['SA_T11_arhebt2u-41']	prayojanaviśeṣopāyatāsaṃśayasya tadabhidhānāt prāgapi bhāvāt /	prayojana viśeṣa upāya tā saṃśayasya tad abhidhānāt prāk api bhāvāt 	Because the doubt as to the means to a special purpose exists even before the statement of that [purpose].

['SA_T11_arhebt2u-45']	api ca kimidaṃ niṣprayojanam /	api ca kim idam niṣprayojanam 	Moreover, is this [text] purposeless?
['SA_T11_arhebt2u-46']	uta prayojanavat /	uta prayojanavat 	Or is it purposeful?

When there is the possibility of activity on the part of one who desires to know this, the statement of the purpose is useless.
['SA_T11_arhebt2u-48']	tasmād 'yat prayojanarahitaṃ vākyam /	tasmāt yat prayojana rahitam vākyam 	Therefore, that sentence which is devoid of purpose,
['SA_T11_arhebt2u-49']	tadartho vā /	tad arthaḥ vā 	or its meaning,
['SA_T11_arhebt2u-50']	na tat prekṣāvatārabhyate kartuṃ pratipādayituṃ vā /	na tat prekṣāvatā ārabhyate kartum pratipādayitum vā 	is not undertaken to be performed or taught by one who is wise.
['SA_T11_arhebt2u-51']	tadyathā Hbṭ 	tat yathā 	For example,
['SA_T11_arhebt2u-52']	daśadāḍimādivākyaṃ kākadantaparīkṣā ca /	daśa dāḍima ādi vākyam kākadanta parīkṣā ca 	the statement about ten pomegranates, etc., and the examination of the crow's teeth.
['SA_T11_arhebt2u-53']	niṣprayojanaṃ cedaṃ prakaraṇaṃ tadartho vā' /	niṣprayojanam ca idam prakaraṇam tad arthaḥ vā 	And this section or its purpose is purposeless.

['SA_T11_arhebt2u-55']	prakaraṇatadabhidheyayoḥ prayojanacintā /	prakaraṇa tad abhidheyayoḥ prayojana cintā 	The purpose is to be considered for the section and its subject matter.

['SA_T11_arhebt2u-57']	yathāsvamabhidheyapratītirhi vākyasya prayojanam /	yathāsvam abhidheya pratītiḥ hi vākyasya prayojanam 	For the purpose of a statement is the understanding of its subject matter, each in its own way.

['SA_T11_arhebt2u-59']	tathā hi anumānamatra prakaraṇe vyutpādyata iti tad abhidheyam /	tathā hi anumānam atra prakaraṇe vyutpādyate iti tat abhidheyam 	For thus, inference is to be taught in this section, so that is its subject matter.
['SA_T11_arhebt2u-60']	tasyaiva tacchabdena sambandhāt /	tasya eva tad śabdena sambandhāt 	Because it is connected with that word itself.

['SA_T11_arhebt2u-62']	anyathā pradhānasaṃsparsorśo	anyathā 	Otherwise, there would be no connection with the primary.

['SA_T11_arhebt2u-65']	pakṣadharma ityādinā cānumānasyaiva vyutpādanāt /	pakṣa dharmaḥ ityādinā ca anumānasya eva vyutpādanāt 	And because inference alone is taught by the statement the property of the subject and so on.

['SA_T11_arhebt2u-67']	tatsādhyatvāt /	tad sādhya tvāt 	Because it is to be accomplished by that.
['SA_T11_arhebt2u-68']	ata eva cānumānavyutpattiviṣayaṃ prakaraṇavyāpāraṃ pratipādayituṃ ṇicā nirdiśati tadvayutpādanārtham iti /	atas eva ca anumāna vyutpatti viṣayam prakaraṇa vyāpāram pratipādayitum ṇicā nirdiśati iti 	And for this very reason, in order to teach the function of the section, which is the subject matter of the production of the understanding of inference, he indicates the section with the word tadvyutpādanārtham (for the purpose of producing the understanding of that).
['SA_T11_arhebt2u-69']	tataśca prakaraṇaprayojanayoḥ sādhyasādhanalakṣaṇaḥ sambandho 'pyukto bhavati /	tatas ca prakaraṇa prayojanayoḥ sādhya sādhana lakṣaṇaḥ sambandhaḥ u pi uktaḥ bhavati 	And thus the relation between the purpose and the section, which is characterized by the accomplishment of what is to be accomplished, is also stated.

['SA_T11_arhebt2u-71']	itarasya ca tadupāyatvenāpradhānatvāt /	itarasya ca tad upāya tvena a pradhāna tvāt 	And because the other is not primary, being a means to that.

['SA_T11_arhebt2u-84']	anena ca sarvā parokṣārthapratipattiḥ pramāṇabhūtā /	anena ca sarvā parokṣa artha pratipattiḥ pramāṇa bhūtā 	And by this it is said that all cognition of imperceptible objects is a means of valid knowledge.
['SA_T11_arhebt2u-85']	anyasmāt tatpratipattyayogāt /	anyasmāt tad pratipatti ayogāt 	Because it is impossible to cognize that from anything else.

['SA_T11_arhebt2u-87']	tataśca śabdādīnāṃ sati prāmāṇye 'numānatā /	tatas ca śabda ādīnām sati prāmāṇye numāna tā 	And therefore, if words etc. are valid means of knowledge, they are inference.

['SA_T11_arhebt2u-90']	na svatantrā bhavati /	na svatantrā bhavati 	It is not independent.
