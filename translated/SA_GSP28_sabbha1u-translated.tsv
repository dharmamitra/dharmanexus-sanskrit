['SA_GSP28_sabbha1u-24']	anyā ca parastād ānantaryam upadiśataḥ /	anyā ca parastāt ānantaryam upadiśataḥ 	and a different one when it teaches immediacy after that.

['SA_GSP28_sabbha1u-34']	evaṃ hi samāmananti vedam adhītya snāyāt iti /	evam hi samāmananti vedam adhītya snāyāt iti 	For they recite thus: Having studied the Veda, one should bathe.

['SA_GSP28_sabbha1u-36']	na ca āmnāyo nāma atikramitavyaḥ /	na ca āmnāyaḥ nāma atikramitavyaḥ 	And a traditional precept should not be transgressed.

['SA_GSP28_sabbha1u-39']	dṛṣṭo hi tasyārthaḥ karmāvabodhanaṃ nāma /	dṛṣṭaḥ hi tasya arthaḥ karma avabodhanam nāma 	For its meaning is seen to be the instruction on ritual.

['SA_GSP28_sabbha1u-44']	na hy atra ānantaryasya vaktā kaścic chabdo 'sti /	na hi atra ānantaryasya vaktā kaścid 	For there is no word here that expresses immediacy.
['SA_GSP28_sabbha1u-45']	pūrvakālatāyāṃ hi ktvā smaryate /	pūrva kāla tāyām hi ktvā smaryate 	For the ktvā suffix is remembered in the sense of prior time.

['SA_GSP28_sabbha1u-47']	dṛṣṭārthatā ca adhyayanasya ānantarye vyāhanyeta /	dṛṣṭārtha tā ca adhyayanasya ānantarye vyāhanyeta 	And the seen purpose of study would be contradicted in the case of immediacy.
['SA_GSP28_sabbha1u-48']	lakṣaṇayā tv eṣo ' rthaḥ syāt /	lakṣaṇayā tu eṣaḥ ṛthaḥ syāt 	But this meaning would be by implication.

['SA_GSP28_sabbha1u-51']	gurukulān ma samāvartiṣṭa ity adṛṣṭārthatāparihārāyaiva /	guru kulāt ma samāvartiṣṭa iti adṛṣṭa artha tā parihārāya eva 	In order to avoid the unseen purpose, that one should not return from the teacher's house.

['SA_GSP28_sabbha1u-64']	dharmāya jijñāsā dharmajijñāsā /	dharmāya jijñāsā dharma jijñāsā 	The seeking to know for the sake of Dharma is the seeking to know Dharma.
['SA_GSP28_sabbha1u-65']	sā hi tasya jñātum icchā /	sā hi tasya jñātum icchā 	For that is the desire to know it.
