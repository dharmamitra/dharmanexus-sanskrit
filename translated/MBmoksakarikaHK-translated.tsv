Even a potter is established as knowing and creating his own effects. For, it has been said, if he were not to know those [effects] even partially, or if he were deficient in power, a pot could not come from him. For this very reason, like a potter,🔽He is all-pervading because He pervades His own effects, because the effect is all-pervading. Even a potter, if he does not pervade the broad base, belly, and mouth of his own effect, is not established as the creator of that [pot], just as [he is not established as the creator] of a mountain.
