['SA_T11_dhkprviu-3']	neti saiva nivṛtter nirvṛttiḥ asataḥ katham iṣṭā /	na iti sā eva nivṛtteḥ nirvṛttiḥ asataḥ katham iṣṭā 	how is that exclusion of non-existence of the non-existent accepted?
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-4']	abhāvapratiṣedho hi bhāvo	abhāva pratiṣedhaḥ hi 	For the negation of non-existence is existence.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-5']	'saty apy asti /	satī api asti 	It exists even if it is non-existent.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-6']	bhāvapratiṣedhas tu na saṃbhavatīty askhalitaprajño devānāṃpriyo yas tadviṣayaṃ pratiṣedhaṃ necchati /	bhāva pratiṣedhaḥ tu na saṃbhavati iti a skhalita prajñaḥ devānām priyaḥ yaḥ tad viṣayam pratiṣedham na icchati 	But the negation of existence is not possible. Therefore, the beloved of the gods with unerring wisdom does not accept a negation that has that [existence] as its object.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-7']	asad abhāva iti ca vyavaharati /	asat abhāvaḥ iti ca vyavaharati 	And he speaks of non-existence as non-existence.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-8']	nirloṭhitaś cāyam artho 'sati nāstitety	nirloṭhitaḥ ca ayam sati nāstitā iti 	And this meaning has been thoroughly examined: In the non-existent, there is no non-existence.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-9']	arthāntare /	artha antare 	In another meaning.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-10']	tena neha pratanyate /	tena na iha pratanyate 	Therefore, it is not elaborated here.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-11']	na cāsann ātmā sattāsādhanavṛtteḥ sandigdhaḥ syāt /	na ca asān ātmā sattā sādhana vṛtteḥ sandigdhaḥ syāt 	And the non-existent self would not be doubtful due to the operation of the means of establishing existence.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-12']	na ca pareṇa tathopagata iti //	na ca pareṇa tathā upagataḥ iti 	And it is not accepted by the opponent in that way.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-13']	apramāṇād abhyupagamāt tathaiva bhavati /	apramāṇāt abhyupagamāt tathā eva bhavati 	It becomes so only from the acceptance based on non-valid cognition.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-14']	atiprasaṅgāt /	atiprasaṅgāt 	Because of over-extension.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-15']	na copagamabalena sapakṣāsapakṣau vyavasthāpya pramāṇapravartanaṃ yuktam /	na ca upagama balena sapakṣa asapakṣau vyavasthāpya pramāṇa pravartanam yuktam 	And it is not proper to establish the similar and dissimilar instances by the power of acceptance and then engage the means of valid cognition.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-16']	evaṃ hy āgamasiddha ātmā syāt /	evam hi āgama siddhaḥ ātmā syāt 	For in this way, the self would be established by scripture.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-17']	nānumānasiddhaḥ /	na anumāna siddhaḥ 	Not established by inference.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-18']	tasmād avyatireke 'py asataḥ /	tasmāt a vyatireke pi asataḥ 	Therefore, even if there is no difference, it is doubtful whether the non-existent
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-19']	sapakṣād vyatirekaḥ sandigdhaḥ	sapakṣāt vyatirekaḥ sandigdhaḥ 	is excluded from the similar instance.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-20']	syāt prāṇādīnāṃ /	syāt prāṇa ādīnām 	It would be doubtful whether life, etc.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-21']	ātmanaḥ sandehāt /	ātmanaḥ sandehāt 	are excluded from the non-self, because the self is doubtful.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-22', 'SA_T11_dhkprviu-23']	ata eva vipakṣād api /🔽ekatra hi niyame siddhe 'nyanivartanaṃ	atas eva vipakṣāt api  ekatra hi niyame siddhe 	For this very reason, it is also doubtful whether [life, etc.] are excluded from the dissimilar instance.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-24']	sidhyet / anyathā kvacid dṛṣṭe 'bhāvasidhāv api syād evādṛṣṭe saṃśayaḥ /	sidhyet anyathā kvacid dṛṣṭe bhāva sidhau api syāt eva adṛṣṭe saṃśayaḥ 	For, when it is established that [life, etc.] are restricted to one [category], the exclusion from the other is established. Otherwise, even if the non-existence is established when [life, etc.] are seen somewhere, there would still be doubt when they are not seen.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-25']	tathā hy asakalavyaktibhedavyāpino 'py arthāḥ kecit tajjātisaṃbhavino dṛṣṭāḥ pārthivālohalekhyavat /	tathā hi a sakala vyakti bheda vyāpinaḥ pi arthāḥ kecid tad jāti saṃbhavinaḥ dṛṣṭāḥ pārthiva āloha lekhya vat 	For indeed, some objects, although pervading the individual differences of the whole, are seen to be possible in that class, like earth and iron in writing.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-26']	virodhasya cādṛṣṭeḥ saṃdeha	virodhasya ca adṛṣṭeḥ saṃdeha 	And because there is no seen contradiction, there is only doubt.

['SA_T11_dhkprviu-28']	sandigdho nairātmyād vyatirekaḥ /	sandigdhaḥ nairātmyāt vyatirekaḥ 	The exclusion from non-self is doubtful.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-29']	ātmapratiniyame hi tatkāryātmatayā prāṇādīnāṃ nairātmyena saha virodhaḥ	ātma pratiniyame hi tad kārya ātmatayā prāṇa ādīnām nairātmyena saha virodhaḥ 	For, if [life, etc.] were restricted to the self, there would be a contradiction of the life, etc. with non-self by their being the effect of the self.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-30']	syāt / sa ca na sidhyatīty uktam /	syāt sa ca na sidhyati iti uktam 	And that is not established, as stated.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-31']	astu nāma nirātmakebhyo vyatirekaḥ prāṇādīnāṃ tadbhāve ca nairātmyavyāvṛttiḥ /	astu nāma nirātmakebhyaḥ vyatirekaḥ prāṇa ādīnām tad bhāve ca nairātmya vyāvṛttiḥ 	Let it be that there is an exclusion of the life, etc. from the non-self, and that when they exist, there is an exclusion of non-self.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-32']	tathāpi nānairātmyād ātmā jīvaccharīre sidhyati /	tathā api na anairātmyāt ātmā jīvat śarīre sidhyati 	Even so, the self is not established in the living body from the exclusion of non-self.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-33']	yenāyaṃ na vyatirekasyābhāvaṃ	yena ayam na vyatirekasya abhāvam 	By which [reasoning] he does not accept the absence of the vyatireka
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-34']	bhāvam icchati /	bhāvam icchati 	as the existence [of the vyatireka].
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-35']	yathā vyatirekābhave 'pi sapakṣe prāṇādir neṣṭaḥ /	yathā vyatireka abhave sa pakṣe prāṇa ādiḥ na iṣṭaḥ 	Just as prāṇa and so on are not accepted as the sapakṣa even when the vyatireka is not possible.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-36']	sapakṣāvyatirekī ced dhetur hetur ato 'nvayī /	sapakṣa avyatirekī ced hetuḥ hetuḥ atas nvayī 	If the reason is not different from the sapakṣa, then the reason is the anvaya.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-37']	nānvayavyatirekī ced anairātmyaṃ na sātmakaṃ /	na anvaya vyatirekī ced anairātmyam na sātmakam 	If it is not the anvaya and vyatireka, then non-self is not with self.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-38']	iti saṃgrahaślokaḥ /	iti saṃgraha ślokaḥ 	This is the summary verse.
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-39']	na prāṇādisaṃbhavena nairātmyavyāvartanād ātmagati /	na prāṇa ādi saṃbhavena nairātmya vyāvartanāt ātma gati 	Not by the possibility of prāṇa and so on, nor by the reversal of non-self, is there the attainment of self.🔽Then what? Prāṇa and so on are
['SA_T11_dhkprviu-40']	kiṃ tarhi vidhimukhenaiva prāṇādayaḥ	kim tarhi vidhi mukhena eva prāṇa ādayaḥ 	by the method of injunction alone.
