Therefore, it is said to be non-eternal.

The sanctification by knowledge is like the consecrated person bathing at a sacred place, etc., because it is complete without the need for a person capable of performing the ritual. The status of being an injunction of the result will be denied.

Therefore, the consideration of the meaninglessness of the Arthavada here is of what has been rejected by being an injunction of the result.
['SA_GSP28_tantrava-10']	stutyarthatāpi cāsatyasya nāstīti vyavasthitameva	stuti arthatā api ca asatyasya na asti iti vyavasthitam eva 	And it is well established that praise is not possible for what is non-existent.

['SA_GSP28_tantrava-14']	ataśca paryudasitavyābhāvānna paryudāsaḥ /	atas ca paryudasitavya abhāvāt na paryudāsaḥ 	And therefore, because there is no object to be excluded, it is not a paryudāsa.

Therefore, the injunction of that is meaningless. Even if it is a restatement of what is eternal, it still has the purpose of action.

['SA_GSP28_tantrava-17']	bādhe ca vidhyānarthakyam /	bādhe ca vidhi ānarthakyam 	And in the contradiction, the injunction is meaningless.
['SA_GSP28_tantrava-18']	vika lpe'pi pakṣe bādhaḥ /	vika lpe pi pakṣe bādhaḥ 	Even in the option, there is contradiction in one case.
['SA_GSP28_tantrava-19']	kāmasaṃyogāccāgnerastyeva pākṣikatvam /	kāma saṃyogāt ca agneḥ asti eva pākṣika tvam 	And because of the connection with desire, the fire certainly has a partial nature.
['SA_GSP28_tantrava-20']	durbalaśca pratiṣedhaḥ /	durbalaḥ ca pratiṣedhaḥ 	And the prohibition is weak.
['SA_GSP28_tantrava-21']	pṛthivīparatve sati cayane kalpyatvāt /	pṛthivī para tve sati cayane kalpya tvāt 	Because it is to be imagined in the piling up, which is secondary to the earth.
['SA_GSP28_tantrava-22']	etadevāsya svayamākulatvam/	etat eva asya svayam ākula tvam 	This is just its own confusion.

And this would confuse.

Thus, the citation of the Vāyavya sentence is for the sake of easily understanding the mere fact that the well-known true purposes are subordinate to the means of knowing dharma by syntactical unity through praise.
['SA_GSP28_tantrava-33']	tatra bhāṣyakārāḥ prasiddhenaivai kavākyatvena stutya rthopayogaṃ vadanti /	tatra bhāṣyakārāḥ prasiddhena eva e kavākyatvena stutya rtha upayogam vadanti 	There, the commentators state the usefulness of praise by syntactical unity with the well-known one itself.

In the case in question, however, the matter dealt with is entirely beyond the reach of the senses, and hence if the meaning of the sentence be assumed to be otherwise than what is directly expressed by it, then the Veda would be open to the charge of being the work of a personal author.

['SA_GSP28_tantrava-40']	tatra ke cidvadanti /	tatra ke cit vadanti 	In this connection, some people argue as follows.

And the relation between action and its instrument is only of the nature of potentiality.

Therefore, when the injunction is already in operation, what is the use of covering it up? Thus, it should be accepted that what is specified by one should also be specified by the other.
['SA_GSP28_tantrava-6729']	na cānarthakyaṃ prakaraṇerthavattvāt /	na ca ānarthakyam prakaraṇa īrthavat tvāt 	And it is not meaningless, because it has meaning in the context.
