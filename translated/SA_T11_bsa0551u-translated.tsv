['SA_T11_bsa0551u-2']	apohaḥ śabdārtho nirucyate /	apohaḥ śabda arthaḥ nirucyate 	Exclusion is declared to be the meaning of a word.

By this derivation, either external objects that are excluded from other species are intended,

['SA_T11_bsa0551u-9']	na tāvadādimau pakṣau /	na tāvat ādimau pakṣau 	First, these two positions are not correct.
['SA_T11_bsa0551u-10']	apohanāmnā vidhereva vivakṣitatvāt /	apoha nāmnā vidheḥ eva vivakṣita tvāt 	Because only affirmation is intended, even by the name of exclusion.
['SA_T11_bsa0551u-11']	antimo 'pyasaṅgataḥ prati tivādhitatvāt /	antimaḥ pi asaṅgataḥ prati ti vādhita tvāt 	The last one is also irrelevant, because it is contradicted by perception.
