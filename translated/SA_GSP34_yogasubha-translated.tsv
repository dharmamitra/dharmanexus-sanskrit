The treatise on the teaching of yoga should be known to be authoritative. Yoga is concentration, and that is the universal attribute of the mind.

Therein, when the mind is scattered, concentration, which is subordinate to distraction, does not belong to the category of yoga.

Therefore, the knowledge of discrimination is the opposite of this. Therefore, the mind, detached from that, stops even that knowledge. Remaining in that state, it becomes the object of impressions. That is seedless samādhi. In it, nothing is known, hence it is called asaṃprajñāta. That yoga is of two kinds: the cessation of modifications of the mind.

And therefore, in the knowledge of the modifications of the mind, the beginningless relation is the cause of the Purusha.

For example, the sun and the stars have motion because they reach different places, like Caitra. The Vindhya mountain has no motion because it does not reach different places. A trustworthy person, having seen or inferred a fact, teaches it to others by means of words, in order to communicate his knowledge to them. The function of the hearer with regard to the object of those words is scripture. That scripture is unreliable whose speaker is not trustworthy, and whose meaning has not been seen or inferred.

All memories arise from the experience of valid cognition, error, imagination, sleep, and memory. And all these modifications have the nature of pleasure, pain, and delusion.

Similarly, the experience of the self in what is not the self, in external instruments, whether sentient or insentient, or in the body which is the seat of enjoyment, or in the mind which is the instrument of the self, is the experience of the self in what is not the self. Thus it is said here: “The manifest or the unmanifest prakriti, considering it as the self, rejoices in its prosperity, considering it as one’s own prosperity, and grieves in its adversity, considering it as one’s own adversity. All this is due to non-discrimination.” And this ignorance has four parts. It is the root of this series of afflictions and of the store of karma with its results.

However, that karma to be experienced in a future birth that has not yet been seen, which is uncertain to have a ripening, either perishes, or goes to a new accumulation, or remains for a long time, being overwhelmed, as long as the cause of manifestation of karma that is the same does not make it face its ripening. Because the place, time, and cause of its ripening are not determined, this course of karma is variegated and difficult to know. And because the general rule is not reversed by exceptions, it is accepted that a heap of karma belongs to a single existence.

That non-cessation due to greed is suffering. And it is not possible to make the senses free from craving by practice in the enjoyment of objects. Why is that? Because the desires and skills of the senses increase in proportion to the practice in the enjoyment of objects. Therefore, the practice in the enjoyment of objects is not a means to happiness. He who, fearing the poison of a scorpion, is bitten by a venomous snake, is immersed in a great mire of suffering, being attached to objects while seeking happiness.

All pain is experienced as being dependent on the means of expression and the means of knowledge, and is mixed with hatred. Therefore, there is a latent impression of action born from hatred. And desiring the means of happiness, one moves the body, speech, and mind. From that, one benefits and harms others. Thus, one accumulates virtue and vice through benefiting and harming others. That latent impression of action arises from greed and delusion. This is said to be the suffering of pain. Now, what is the suffering of the formative forces? From the experience of pleasure, there is the latent tendency for the formative forces of pleasure. From the experience of pain, there is also the latent tendency for the formative forces of pain. Thus, when the results of actions are being experienced as pleasure or pain, there is again an accumulation of latent impressions of action.

Why is it so? Because the learned one is like a bowl for the eyes. Just as a wool thread placed in a bowl for the eyes causes pain by touch, but not in other parts of the body, so do these sufferings trouble only the yogi, who is like a bowl for the eyes, not the other practitioner. But the other one, to whom suffering is brought by his own karma, abandons what is taken, takes what is abandoned, and is as if completely penetrated by the variegated mental activity of beginningless tendencies, and is followed by the sense of I and mine. As soon as it is born, the three-fold torments arising from external, internal, and both causes befall it. Seeing himself and the group of beings thus tossed about by the beginningless stream of suffering, the yogi takes refuge in right view, which is the cause of the destruction of all suffering.

And the mode of the gunas is mobile, so the mind is said to be quickly changing. The superimpositions of form and the superimpositions of modes contradict each other, but the universals operate together with the superimpositions. Thus, these gunas, having attained the impressions of pleasure, pain, and delusion by mutual dependence, become all of all forms.

Just as victory or defeat, which occur in the warriors, are spoken of in relation to the king, because he is the enjoyer of their fruits, in the same way, bondage and liberation, which occur in the intellect itself, are spoken of in relation to the Purusha, because he is the enjoyer of their fruits. The incompleteness of the purpose of the Purusha due to the intellect is bondage, and the ascertainment of that purpose is liberation. Thus, grasping, retaining, superimposition, exclusion, knowledge of reality, and attachment, which occur in the intellect, are superimposed on the Purusha, because he is the enjoyer of their fruits.

In the beginning, the state of being for the purpose of the person is not the cause of the state without specific attributes. Therefore, that [state without specific attributes] is not the cause for the purpose of the person. It is said to be eternal because it is not done for the purpose of the person. However, for the three specific states, the purpose of the person is the cause in the beginning. And that purpose is the cause, the reason, for the state of having specific attributes. It is said to be non-eternal. But the qualities, which pervade all things, do not set or arise. They appear as if they have the dharma of arising and ceasing through the manifestations that have past, future, destruction, and acquisition. Just as it is said, Devadatta becomes poor. Why? Because his cows die. The becoming poor is due to the death of the cows alone, not due to the loss of his own form. The meditation is the same.

That Purusha is the experiencer of Buddhi. He is not of the same form as Buddhi, nor is he absolutely of a different form. First, he is not of the same form. Why? Because the object is known and unknown. For Buddhi, which undergoes modifications, has an object that is both known and unknown, such as a cow or a pot.

Why? For Buddhi cannot be both the object of Purusha and both grasped and ungrasped. Thus it is established that the object of Purusha is always known, and hence it is immutable. Moreover, Buddhi is for the sake of another, because it acts collectively. Purusha is for his own sake. Thus, because it determines all objects, Buddhi is endowed with the three qualities. Because it is endowed with the three qualities, it is insentient. But Purusha is the witness of the qualities. Therefore, he is not of the same form.

The intellect, having performed its function, is like a stone thrown from the peak of a mountain, having no support, facing dissolution in its own cause, goes to rest along with it. And for them, once dissolved, there is no arising again, due to the absence of purpose. In this state, the liberated soul, having gone beyond the connection with the qualities, is the pure light of its own nature alone, free from the qualities. The person who contemplates this sevenfold wisdom of the final stage is called skilled. And even when the mind is withdrawn, he becomes free and skilled, due to having gone beyond the qualities.

Then he causes suffering by striking with weapons etc. Then he deprives him of life. Then due to the loss of energy, his animate and inanimate equipment becomes devoid of energy. Due to the production of suffering, he experiences suffering in hells, animal realms, ghost realms etc. Due to the deprivation of life, he is constantly on the verge of losing life, and though desiring death, he somehow breathes due to the definite ripening of the fruits of suffering. And if the violence were somehow to lead to the attainment of merit, there would be a short life in the attainment of happiness. Thus, falsehood etc. should be applied as appropriate.

For example, clay powder, clay lump, clay pot, clay pot shard, and clay particle - this is the sequence. The dharma that immediately follows a certain dharma is its sequence. The clay lump perishes and the pot is produced - this is the sequence of the transformation of dharmas. The sequence of the transformation of characteristics is the sequence of the pot's transition from the future state to the present state. Similarly, the sequence of the clay lump's transition from the present state to the past state is the sequence. The past does not have a sequence. Why? Because immediacy exists in the relation of prior and posterior. But that does not exist for the past, therefore the sequence is only of two characteristics. Similarly, the sequence of the transformation of states is also seen in a newly made pot, its oldness at the end. And that, being manifested by a sequence that continues through a series of moments, reaches its highest manifestation. And by the characteristics of dharmas and by the sequence of states,

The loosening of that karma, which is the cause of bondage, occurs through the power of concentration, and the awareness of the functioning of the mind is also due to concentration alone. Due to the destruction of the bondage of karma through concentration, the yogi extracts the mind from his own body and deposits it in other bodies. And when the mind is deposited, the senses follow it.

The place where the first myrobalan fruit is present is different from the place where the second myrobalan fruit is present. And those myrobalan fruits are different in experiencing their own places and moments. But the experience of other places and moments is the cause of their difference. By this example, the place of the atom of the same class and characteristic as the previous atom is directly perceived simultaneously with the place of the previous atom. Therefore, the experience of the place of the subsequent atom is different from that of the previous atom, due to the difference in simultaneous moments. The cognition of difference in the subsequent atom from the previous atom arises in the mind of the yogin.

Then the absence of the enjoyment of the Spirit, which is only a semblance, is purity. In this state, there is isolation of the Spirit, whether it be of the Lord or of the non-Lord, or of any other who has a share in the knowledge born of discrimination. For one whose seeds of afflictions are burnt, there is no further need of knowledge. This lordship and knowledge born of concentration are obtained through the purification of the Sattva. But in reality, from knowledge, non-perception ceases. When that ceases, there are no further afflictions. Due to the absence of afflictions, there is the absence of the fruition of actions. And in this state, the qualities, having fulfilled their purpose, do not present themselves to the Spirit as objects of perception again. That is the isolation of the Spirit. Then the Spirit becomes pure, isolated, and the light of its own nature alone.

Among them, the black is of the wicked. The white-black is accomplished by external means. There, the accumulation of the substratum of action is only through the door of harming and benefiting others. The white is of those who have austerity, self-study, and meditation. For that depends solely on the mind, and not on external means, so it does not arise by harming others. The neither-white-nor-black is of the ascetics and those whose defilements are exhausted and who have their last bodies. Among them, the neither-white of the yogis is because of the renunciation of fruits, and the not-black because of the absence of accumulation.

Why? Because even for the obstructed ones, the similar action becomes the instrumental cause for manifestation, so there is immediate succession itself. And why? Because memory and latent impressions are of the same form. As are the experiences, so are the latent impressions. And those are in accordance with the impressions of karma. And as are the impressions, so is memory. Thus memory arises from the latent impressions obstructed by birth, place, and time. And from memory again arise latent impressions. Thus these memories and latent impressions are manifested by the power of the arising of the activity of the store of karma. And therefore, even for the obstructed ones, immediate succession itself is established due to the continuity of the relation between the cause and effect.

Indeed, that is not imagined by one mind nor imagined by many minds, but rather is self-established. How so? In the case of similarity of objects, due to the difference in minds, the mind's object depends on dharma. In the case of similarity of objects, there is the knowledge of pleasure due to the dependence on non-dharma, and from that itself there is the knowledge of pain. Due to the dependence on ignorance, there is the knowledge of delusion from that itself. Due to the dependence on right view, there is the knowledge of neutrality from that itself. Whose is that, imagined by the mind? And it is not proper for one mind to be affected by an object imagined by another mind. Therefore, the path is divided for the object and knowledge, which are differentiated by the difference between the grasped and the grasper. There is not even a trace of confusion between these two.

The natural contemplation of one's own existence proceeds from that. It is said that due to the absence of this, one has a preference for the prima facie view and a lack of preference for the conclusion, leaving aside one's nature. There, the contemplation of one's own existence is: What was I? How was I? What is this? How is this? What will we be? Or how will we be? But that ceases for one who has special insight. From what? This is the variegated transformation of the mind itself. But the person, when ignorance does not exist, is pure and untouched by the qualities of the mind. Therefore, the contemplation of one's own existence ceases for the virtuous one.
