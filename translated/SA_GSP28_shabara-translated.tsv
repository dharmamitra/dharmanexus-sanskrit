['SA_GSP28_shabara-2']	nādhyāhārādibhir eṣāṃ parikalpanīyo 'rthaḥ / paribhāṣitavyo vā /	na adhyāhāra ādibhiḥ eṣām parikalpanīyaḥ rthaḥ paribhāṣitavyaḥ vā 	The meaning of these [words] should not be imagined by supplying [unstated] terms, etc., nor should it be defined.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-3']	evaṃ hi vedavākyāny evaibhir vyākhyāyante /	evam hi veda vākyāni eva ebhiḥ vyākhyāyante 	For in this way, the Vedic sentences are explained by these [aphorisms].

['SA_GSP28_shabara-5']	tad yatnagauravaṃ prasajyeta /	tat yatna gauravam prasajyeta 	That would lead to the fault of great effort.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-6']	tatra loke 'yam athaśabdo vṛttād anantarasya prakriyārtho dṛṣṭaḥ /	tatra loke yam atha śabdaḥ vṛttāt anantarasya prakriyā arthaḥ dṛṣṭaḥ 	In ordinary usage, this word atha is seen to have the meaning of after this and for the sake of undertaking.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-7']	na ceha kiñcid vṛttam upalabhyate /	na ca iha kiñcid vṛttam upalabhyate 	And here, no this is perceived.

['SA_GSP28_shabara-9']	tathā hi prasiddhapadārthakaḥ sa kalpito bhavati /	tathā hi prasiddha padārthakaḥ sa kalpitaḥ bhavati 	For in this way, it is imagined to have a well-known meaning.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-10']	tat tu vedādhyayanam /	tat tu veda adhyayanam 	And that is the study of the Vedas.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-11']	tasmin hi sati sāvakalpate /	tasmin hi sati sā avakalpate 	For when that exists, it is possible.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-12']	naitad evam /	na etat evam 	This is not so.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-13']	anyasyāpi karmaṇo 'nantaraṃ dharmajijñāsā yuktā / prāg api ca vedādhyayanāt /	anyasya api karmaṇaḥ nantaram dharma jijñāsā yuktā prāk api ca veda adhyayanāt 	The inquiry into Dharma is appropriate after any other action, and even before the study of the Vedas.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-14']	yady evam / na tarhi vedādhyayanaṃ pūrvaṃ dharmajijñāsāyāḥ /	yadi evam na tarhi veda adhyayanam pūrvam dharma jijñāsāyāḥ 	If that is so, then the study of the Veda is not prior to the desire to know religious duty.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-15']	evaṃ hi samāmananti vedam adhītya snāyād iti /	evam hi samāmananti vedam adhītya snāyāt iti 	For they recite thus: Having studied the Veda, one should bathe.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-16']	iha ca vedam adhītya snāsyan dharmaṃ jijñāsamāna imam āmnāyam atikrāmet /	iha ca vedam adhītya snāsyan dharmam jijñāsamānaḥ imam āmnāyam atikrāmet 	And here, one who is about to bathe after studying the Veda, desiring to know religious duty, would transgress this traditional precept.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-17']	na cāmnāyo nāmātikramitavyaḥ /	na ca āmnāyaḥ nāma atikramitavyaḥ 	And a traditional precept should not be transgressed.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-18']	tad ucyate atikramiṣyāma imam āmnāyam /	tat ucyate atikramiṣyāmaḥ imam āmnāyam 	We say: We will transgress this traditional precept.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-19']	anatikrāmanto vedam arthavantaṃ santam anarthakaṃ kalpayema /	an atikrāmantaḥ vedam arthavantam santam anarthakam kalpayema 	Without transgressing, we would make the Veda, which is meaningful, meaningless.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-20']	dṛṣṭo hi tasyārthaḥ karmāvabodhanaṃ nāma /	dṛṣṭaḥ hi tasya arthaḥ karma avabodhanam nāma 	For its meaning, namely the teaching of ritual, is seen.

['SA_GSP28_shabara-23']	na cādhītavedasya snānānantaryam etad vidhīyate /	na ca adhīta vedasya snāna ānantaryam etat vidhīyate 	And this is not enjoined as immediately following the bathing of one who has studied the Veda.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-24']	na hy atrānataryasya vaktā kaścic chabdo 'sti /	na hi atra anataryasya vaktā kaścid śabdaḥ sti 	For there is no word here that expresses immediacy.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-25']	pūrvakālatāyāṃ hi ktvā smaryate / nānantarye /	pūrva kāla tāyām hi ktvā smaryate na ānantarye 	For the ktvā suffix is remembered in the sense of prior time, not in the sense of immediacy.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-26']	dṛṣṭārthatā cādhyayanasyānantarye vyāhanyeta /	dṛṣṭārtha tā ca adhyayanasya ānantarye vyāhanyeta 	And the purposefulness of the study would be contradicted by the immediacy.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-27']	lakṣaṇayā tv eṣo 'rthaḥ syāt /	lakṣaṇayā tu eṣaḥ rthaḥ syāt 	But this meaning would be by implication.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-28']	na cedaṃ snānam adṛṣṭārthaṃ vidhīyate /	na ca idam snānam adṛṣṭa artham vidhīyate 	And this bathing is not enjoined for an unseen purpose.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-29']	kiṃ tu lakṣaṇayāsnānādiniyamasya paryavasānaṃ vedādhyayanasamakālam āhuḥ vedam adhītya snāyād / gurukulān mā samāvartiṣṭety adṛṣṭārthatāparihārāyaiva /	kim tu lakṣaṇayā asnāna ādi niyamasya paryavasānam veda adhyayana sama kālam āhuḥ vedam adhītya snāyāt guru kulāt mā samāvartiṣṭa iti adṛṣṭa artha tā parihārāya eva 	But by implication they say that the conclusion of the rule of bathing etc. is at the same time as the study of the Veda: Having studied the Veda, one should bathe, one should not return from the teacher's house. This is only to avoid the unseen purpose.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-30']	ataḥśabdo vṛttasyāpadeśako hetvarthena / yathā kṣemasubhikṣo 'yaṃ deśaḥ / ato 'ham asmin deśe prativasāmīti /	atas śabdaḥ vṛttasya apadeśakaḥ hetu arthena yathā kṣema subhikṣaḥ yam deśaḥ atas ham asmin deśe prativasāmi iti 	The word 'ataḥ' (therefore) is a statement of the reason, meaning 'for this reason', just as 'this country is peaceful and prosperous, therefore I live in this country.'
['SA_GSP28_shabara-31']	evam adhīto vedo dharmajijñāsāyāṃ hetur jñātaḥ / anantaraṃ dharmo jijñāsitavyaḥ ity ataḥśabdasya sāmarthyam /	evam adhītaḥ vedaḥ dharma jijñāsāyām hetuḥ jñātaḥ anantaram dharmaḥ jijñāsitavyaḥ iti atas śabdasya sāmarthyam 	In the same way, the studied Veda is known to be the reason for the desire to know Dharma. The meaning of the word 'ataḥ' (therefore) is that after that, Dharma should be desired to be known.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-32']	dharmāya hi vedavākyāni vicārayitum anadhītavedo na śaknuyāt /	dharmāya hi veda vākyāni vicārayitum anadhīta vedaḥ na śaknuyāt 	For one who has not studied the Veda cannot consider the Vedic statements for the sake of Dharma.

This is the meaning of the word 'ataḥ'.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-34']	dharmāya jijñāsā dharmajijñāsā /	dharmāya jijñāsā dharma jijñāsā 	The desire to know Dharma is the desire to know Dharma.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-35']	sā hi tasya jñātum icchā /	sā hi tasya jñātum icchā 	For that is the desire to know it.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-36']	sa punaḥ kathaṃ jijñāsitavyaḥ / ko dharmaḥ / kathaṃlakṣaṇaḥ / kāny asya sādhanāni / kāni sādhanābhāsāni / kiṃparaś ceti /	sa punar katham jijñāsitavyaḥ kaḥ dharmaḥ kathaṃlakṣaṇaḥ kāni asya sādhanāni kāni sādhana ābhāsāni kiṃparaḥ ca iti 	How is that to be investigated? What is Dharma? What is its characteristic? What are its means? What are its false means? And what is its purpose?
['SA_GSP28_shabara-37']	tatra ko dharmaḥ / kathaṃlakṣaṇa ity ekenaiva sūtreṇa vyākhyātaṃ codanālakṣaṇo 'rtho dharma iti /	tatra kaḥ dharmaḥ kathaṃlakṣaṇaḥ iti ekena eva sūtreṇa vyākhyātam codanā lakṣaṇaḥ rthaḥ dharmaḥ iti 	There, what is Dharma? What is its characteristic? This is explained by a single aphorism: Dharma is the meaning characterized by injunction.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-38']	kāny asya sādhanāni / kāni sādhanābhāsāni / kiṃparaś ceti śeṣalakṣaṇena vyākhyātam /	kāni asya sādhanāni kāni sādhana ābhāsāni kiṃparaḥ ca iti śeṣa lakṣaṇena vyākhyātam 	What are its means?

['SA_GSP28_shabara-45']	dharmaṃ prati hi vipratipannā bahuvidaḥ /	dharmam prati hi vipratipannāḥ bahu vidaḥ 	For many learned people disagree about Dharma.
['SA_GSP28_shabara-46']	kecid anyaṃ dharmam āhuḥ / kecid anyam /	kecid anyam dharmam āhuḥ kecid anyam 	Some say one thing is Dharma, others another.

['SA_GSP28_shabara-48']	tasmād dharmo jijñāsitavyaḥ /	tasmāt dharmaḥ jijñāsitavyaḥ 	Therefore, Dharma should be inquired into.

And in case of contradiction, the Vedic text is stronger, so the deityhood of all the gods is in the sentence about curds, not in the sentence about the strong one. This is determined. Therefore it is understood that it is connected with the deity word that is not the original.

The connection that has been accomplished, that the Vāravantiya is to be accomplished, is stated for the sake of the sacrifice. By that, the connection is understood. Both of these meanings, the Vāravantiya and the Revatī verses, the word 'having accomplished' is able to express, both the accomplishment and the prior time. Just as when it is said 'bring the red one', the horse connected with the quality of redness is enjoined by the word itself as to be brought, and there is no split of the sentence.
