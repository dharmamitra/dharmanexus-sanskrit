['SA_T11_arhebt_u-33']	prekṣāvat tāto na hīyeran /	prekṣāvat tātaḥ na hīyeran 	Thus, they would not lose their quality of being rational agents.

['SA_T11_arhebt_u-35']	na ca prayojanavākyasya prāmāṇyam asti /	na ca prayojana vākyasya prāmāṇyam asti 	And the statement of purpose is not a means of valid knowledge.

['SA_T11_arhebt_u-38']	ṣaṃ prati upāyatāniścayaḥ samasti /	prati upāya tā niścayaḥ samasti 	Even if that statement of purpose were a means of valid knowledge in regard to intention, since there is no rule that engagement must occur in accordance with reality, from that there is no ascertainment of the specific purpose of the context as a means.

Because in the world, when people have the intention to deceive, it is seen that they express one thing and act in another way.

['SA_T11_arhebt_u-50']	tasmād yat prayojanarahitaṃ vākyam /	tasmāt yat prayojana rahitam vākyam 	Therefore, that sentence which is devoid of purpose,

['SA_T11_arhebt_u-55']	prakaraṇatadabhidheyayoḥ prayojanacintā /	prakaraṇa tad abhidheyayoḥ prayojana cintā 	The consideration of the purpose of the section and its subject matter.

['SA_T11_arhebt_u-57']	yathāsvam abhidheyapratītir hi vākyasya prayojanam /	yathāsvam abhidheya pratītiḥ hi vākyasya prayojanam 	For the purpose of a sentence is the understanding of its meaning, as appropriate.

['SA_T11_arhebt_u-59']	tathā hi anumānamatra prakaraṇe vyutpādyata iti tad abhidheyam /	tathā hi anumānam atra prakaraṇe vyutpādyate iti tat abhidheyam 	For thus, inference is being taught in this section, so that is what is to be stated.
['SA_T11_arhebt_u-60']	tasyaiva tacchabdena sambandhāt /	tasya eva tad śabdena sambandhāt 	Because it is only that which is connected with the word 'that'.

['SA_T11_arhebt_u-65']	pakṣadharma ityādinā cānumānasyaiva vyutpādanāt /	pakṣa dharmaḥ ityādinā ca anumānasya eva vyutpādanāt 	And because inference alone is taught by the words 'the property of the subject' and so on.

['SA_T11_arhebt_u-72']	itarasyaca tadupāyatvenāpradhānatvāt /	tad upāya tvena a pradhāna tvāt 	And the other (function of the context) is not primary because it is a means to that (learning).
