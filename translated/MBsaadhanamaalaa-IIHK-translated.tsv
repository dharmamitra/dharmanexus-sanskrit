This text is a collection of sādhanas, that is, procedures for the worship of Buddhist tantric deities, especially those of the Anuttarayoga tantras. A description of the deity, its form and color, vehicle, etc., along with its related visualization, is supplied in each sādhana, together with that deity's mantra and its applications in worship and yogic practice. They are composed by a large range of Buddhist teachers, many of them eminent. The earliest is the siddha Saraha, who is dated to around the 1st century CE. Along with him are a number of other great Buddhist siddhas, such as Nāgārjuna, Kukkuri, Indrabhūti, Kṛṣṇācārya, Śavari, and others who belonged to the 7th-12th centuries. The last contribution to the collection is by the great Tibetan translator Rinchen Zangpo (958-1055). The collection is thus a comprehensive survey of the sādhana literature of the Anuttarayoga tantras, and is a valuable resource for the study of Buddhist tantra.
