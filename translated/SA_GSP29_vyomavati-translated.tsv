Therefore, the commentary is a summary of Praśastapāda's aphorisms. The absence of an object to be qualified is not due to non-appearance, like the absence of a qualified object. That is not so. Because it is to be understood from the teaching. It is like this. For one who has made an agreement regarding substances etc., the knowledge that follows is not contradicted. Because the knowledge this is a Brahmin is not contradicted later, the person who is the object of the word good is established as a valid means of knowledge. Therefore, there is no fault of being objectless. The absence of denotation is not contradicted in substances etc. ... The existence is indeed refuted. Because it is mentioned. Similarly, because the purpose is stated, its absence is stated.

For if the self is eternal and blissful, then the experience of that would also be eternal, and so there would be no possibility of obstruction. This is because in the production of knowledge in the self about objects like form, the non-production of knowledge about another object is obstruction. Similarly, for the sense organ also, when engaged in generating knowledge about one object, the non-generation of knowledge about another object is obstruction. And in the same way, in the production of knowledge in the self about objects like form, there is no possibility of non-knowledge about eternal bliss, because that knowledge is also eternal. And it cannot be said that it is not experienced because it is obstructed by the body etc., because it is eternal itself. This is because an obstruction is said to be that which defeats an effect. And the non-production of the knowledge of eternal bliss is not possible. Moreover, since the body etc. are for the purpose of enjoyment, it is not possible for them to obstruct enjoyment. It is not observed that something is an obstruction to that for the sake of which it exists. If it were an obstruction, then the result of harming the remover of that would not be possible.

And what is contrary to what is seen cannot be accepted. But an effect cannot be accidental. For this very reason, because there is no eternal happiness or knowledge, the knowledge I slept happily is not memory. Then what?

Or, in the opposite case, it would be eternal suffering, because of the memory I slept unhappily due to eternal suffering, I slept unhappily.

For there is no other universal, like egoity, common to both substance and quality. If it means being the substratum of pleasure, that is not possible, because the alternatives of being eternal or non-eternal do not apply. Similarly, if it means being the substratum of the universal of pleasure, or being the substratum of pleasure, there is the alternative of the knowledge of that being eternal or non-eternal. The means of knowledge is inconclusive, because it exists even in the absence of pain, though it is taken up with the sole purpose of producing the idea of supreme bliss.

For, when the existence of primordial matter is established, the doctrine of the soul's discrimination of that [primordial matter] is possible. Or, let us approach [the matter] in another way. If primordial matter operates without depending on a cause, it would operate even in a liberated soul to produce the body and so on. Because there is no difference [between the two cases]. If it is argued that it depends on non-perception, then primordial matter operates for one for whom the discrimination of the difference between the constituents and the soul is not possible. And that is not so for a liberated soul. That is not so, because there is the contingence of operation even in a liberated soul due to the destruction of the discrimination of difference. And we do not see any difference between non-arising and destruction in terms of non-perception. If it is argued that it operates depending on the unseen [force], that is not so. Because, even for that [unseen force], which exists in the form of potentiality in primordial matter, there is no difference in both cases [i.e., in a bound soul and a liberated soul]. Similarly, there is the absence of diversity in the body and so on, because it [i.e., the unseen force] is of one form. And it is not so because of the diversity of modifications.

Similarly, in the contemplation that everything is without self, there is no thought of I or other or this is mine. When there is no attachment or aversion, the arising of a pure continuum of mind certainly occurs. And thus, because cloth etc. are negated, everything is empty. Thus, the knowledge of the noble truths of suffering, origination, cessation, and path is the cause of the highest good. Thus, suffering is the five aggregates beginning with form. Its origination is the cause, because it arises from that. The cessation of those two is destruction. The means to that is the path. Thus, it is reasonable that the highest good is the arising of a pure continuum of mind or its cessation, due to the power of the knowledge of these noble truths.

If it is meditated upon in this way for the purpose of prohibiting attachment, that is not so, because it exists in another way. Thus, it is seen that the knowledge of the truth of things is the cause of engagement, and the perception of faults is the cause of disengagement. Just as one engages in food mixed with honey and poison due to the perception of qualities and the non-perception of faults, and disengages from it due to the perception of faults, not due to the prohibition of the object. Similarly, it should be said that the perception of deformity in the self's wife etc. is the cause of disengagement, not the absence of relation. That prohibition should be meditated upon. And it has been said by the author of the Nyāyabhāṣya that the meditation on the cause etc. of form etc. should be done, not the meditation on the details.

But it is said by the method of hypothetical negative reasoning: It is not reasonable for a knowledge free from attachment etc. to arise from a knowledge with attachment etc., because of the identity of their nature. For just as the nature of knowledge is known from knowledge in another knowledge, so too attachment etc. would be, because of the identity of their nature. Or, if it were otherwise, there would be the consequence of their non-existence. And there is no valid cognition that the nature of knowledge arises from knowledge, because an effect with a different nature is seen to arise from a cause with a different nature. For this very reason, the being prior to it, belonging to the same class, or being in the same continuum of this knowledge is not a cause for being the cause of another knowledge, because of inconstancy. For example, the being prior to it is inconsistent with those of the same moment, and the belonging to the same class is inconsistent with the knowledge of another continuum.

Because false knowledge is prohibited as the cause of liberation. And the knowledge of non-absolutism is itself false, because of the occurrence of refutation. Thus, because permanence and impermanence are of the nature of injunction and prohibition, there is non-existence in the undifferentiated substratum. Similarly, existence and non-existence, etc. also. And this that the pot, etc. are permanent in the form of clay, etc., is false. Because the form of clay is different from that. Thus, the form of clay is different from the pot, etc. Clay-ness is a universal, but the pot does not exist in that way, because it is different from that. But the pot's destruction is observed from its cause, so it is impermanent. And this that existence in one's own place, etc. and non-existence in another's place, etc. is accepted itself, because mutual absence is accepted.

And it is not reasonable that the bodies etc. which are subject to origination should be imperishable. Similarly, even in liberation, non-duality does not cease, so it would be that the liberated one is both liberated and not liberated. And if this is so, it follows that the very same liberated one is both transmigrating and not transmigrating. Thus, even in non-duality, the fault lies in accepting non-duality. For the reality is of the nature of both existence and non-existence, it is indeterminate. If that too is accepted as indeterminate, then another form is also directly perceived. Thus, it should be said that there is another form apart from the nature of being eternal and non-eternal, and so on.

For, there is no means of valid knowledge to prove that all objects have the nature of sound. If it is argued that there is no means of valid knowledge to prove difference, that is not correct. Because objects devoid of the nature of sound appear through the eye and other sense organs. For, the nature of sound is audibility, which belongs to an existent object. And this does not exist in objects, because they are not grasped by the ear. If it is argued that the diversity of perception is due to the difference in states of sound itself, that is not so. For, that would be possible only if there were the nature of sound. And there is no means of valid knowledge to prove that. If it is argued that the appearance itself is the means of valid knowledge due to contact with sound, that is not so. Because air and other things for which no convention has been made appear even without that. And contact with another sound is not proper, because that would lead to the futility of the convention.

But for one of slow intellect, it does not come because of the absence of a specific dharma.

If it is argued that it arises only after memory, because the object is destroyed simultaneously with the momentary non-conceptual cognition, and therefore it is not a valid means of knowledge due to being objectless, it is not so. When momentariness is not established, even that which arises after memory has the object as its cause, like the non-conceptual cognition, because it conforms to the presence and absence of the object. If it is argued that if it has the object as its cause, the object would exist simultaneously with the non-conceptual cognition, and the sense faculties would not be able to discriminate, that is not so. Because of the absence of a cooperating factor. Thus, in the production of conceptual cognition regarding objects, the sense faculty depends on the memory of convention.

Thus, determinate cognition would be objectless. That is not so. Because the doctrine of form will be refuted later, the form of words does not exist in cognition. But the difference in auxiliaries is the cause for the difference in cognition, as stated.

If it is argued that the impression nourished from beginningless time exists, that is not so, because there is no evidence for its existence. If it is argued that determinate cognition itself is the evidence, that is not so, because it exists even otherwise. Thus, how can the existence of impression be established when it is possible even in the presence of the object? And the relation of cause and effect is understood elsewhere also by positive and negative concomitance, and those two are present here also with regard to the sense organ. If it is argued that the operation of the sense organ in the production of indeterminate cognition is inferred as the basis of the operation in determinate cognition also, that is not so, because the operation is possible in both cases even if it is not momentary. And there is no restriction that indeterminate cognition alone is the cause of the production of determinate cognition through the recollection of convention, because perception is invariably the object of specific individuality and hence cannot be the object of succession.

If the cause is only vāsanā, and that is not different from consciousness, because no cause is accepted apart from the knowledge of form, taste, smell, touch, and sound, then if they are identical, there would be no diversity of conceptual cognitions, because of the absence of any distinction in the form of cognition in all cases. If it is argued that the diversity of vāsanās is due to the diversity of conceptual cognitions, not to the effect, then, if those vāsanās are not different from consciousness, they would have to be one like consciousness. Or consciousness would have to be many, because of the identity with many external objects. In the contrary case, the identity is not possible. And if vāsanā is the cause of a particular cognition and external, then only the name would be different, the object being vāsanā. If vāsanā is of the nature of an entity, then it cannot produce cognition, because the characteristic of an entity is to perform a function.

If accepted, even non-conceptual cognition would be conceptual, because thus: after the recollection of form, when there is contact of taste with the tongue, knowledge of taste arises. And there, since recollection exists prior to that time, by the principle that the immediate cause is of the nature of cognition, let that also be conceptual, because it exists subsequent to recollection. And here it cannot be said that the immediate cause is by the nature of cognition, and elsewhere by the nature of memory, because the nature of memory, which is different from cognition, does not exist in identity with it. And when there is non-difference, the arrangement is not possible that somewhere the immediate cause is by the nature of cognition, and elsewhere by a different nature. Therefore, being subsequent to recollection is not conceptual cognition. And when the arising by the manifestation of name, genus, etc. is established as arising from the object, it is not a fault.

It is not the aggregate of form etc., because the aggregate of form etc. is not the object of a single sense organ, as form etc. are grasped by their respective sense organs. And the aggregate of form etc., which is not ultimately real, cannot produce cognition. And there is no proof for the existence of atoms when they are not perceived, because they are to be inferred from their effects. And there is no uncombined atom, because of the simultaneous conjunction with six [other atoms]. Therefore, it also does not exist ultimately. And what is not accumulated does not become the object of our perception. Thus, there would be the consequence that the cognition of a pot etc. is without an object.

Or, if it is argued that the undesirable consequence is imposed on the opponent by the opponent's pervasion, the opponent has accepted the whole and has therefore been included as the subject, because it is to be taught. There, if the opponent has understood it through a valid means of knowledge, then the counter-inference does not arise because it is being contradicted by that itself.

And the word 'difference' is not appropriate for an indivisible whole, because it is seen in many. Thus, the designation of one among many is a part, and the meaning of the word 'all' is without remainder. Similarly, the existence in a different way is due to the subject matter of the permission of the rest by the negation of the particular. Otherwise, it should be said that it does not exist.

Because it is apprehended by the contact of the whole with the sense organ, which is aided by the contact of many parts with the sense organ.

Therefore, they exist in reality. Here, regarding what is posited as the subject, being the object of knowledge that is not negated is the property of the subject.

For wherever the presence of light is prohibited by an obstructing substance, there the convention of 'shadow' is used. And one understands the action belonging to the obstructing substance as projected onto the absence of light, thinking 'the shadow moves'. Otherwise, the requirement of action belonging to the obstructing substance would not be possible. And what is this having the property of reaching another place? Is it conjunction with another place or inherence? It cannot be conjunction, because that is also to be established. For thus: when substancehood is established, conjunction is established; from conjunction, substancehood - this would be mutual dependence. Now, if reaching another place is inherence, that is also unestablished. For what inheres in one thing does not inhere in another. But a shadow, being perceived as connected in one place, is perceived again in another place. And the property of having action is not established from inhering in another place. That is not established together.

Because the qualifier is observed to be inhering only in qualities, actions and universals. And the inherence of number in qualities is not possible due to their being devoid of qualities.

And he will say: The eternal substances are called 'anta' (end) because they are established at the end of origination and destruction. Those belonging to them are explained as 'antiya' (belonging to the end). And those particulars distinguish, i.e., exclude, their substratum from other substrata. For the sake of examination, he says: And because they are the cause of the cognition of absolute exclusion at all times, they are particulars only, not universals. This is because atoms, which are the substrata of similar class, quality and action, are related to particulars, because they are the objects of exclusive cognition. Whatever is the object of exclusive cognition is related to particulars, like a post etc. And atoms are the objects of exclusive cognition. Therefore, they are related to particulars. And the fact of being the object of exclusive cognition is observed in pots etc., so it is proved even in eternal substances only by the reason of being a substance. And the fact of being the object of exclusive cognition is not common to quality etc.

He says that inherence is ultimately real, due to the same reason stated earlier. The definition is stated: The cause of the cognition of 'here' is also the relation, even though the intervening space is not seen. The connection is grasped thus. For instance, when people do not see the intervening space between a village and a garden from a distance, they have the knowledge The trees are here in the village. Even so, there is deviation due to the relation between a bird in the sky. Therefore, here the cause of the cognition of 'here' is the relation. For instance, the knowledge The bird is here in the sky is seen. To exclude that, the grasping of the object and the substratum is mentioned. And the sky is neither the substratum nor the object. Because there is no relation of lower and higher. Where there is the relation of lower and higher in conjoined substances, there alone the relation of substratum and object is observed, as in a pot and a jujube fruit, and that is absent in the sky. Because it pervades the bird by being present as its pervader.

Because there is inconstancy due to the relation of denoted and denotative, and of object and subject. For instance, the greatness of space is inherent in space and is denoted by the word greatness. The relation of denoted and denotative between the greatness of space and that word is not simultaneous production, because it is not inherent in different substrates.

When Inherence is not established, Inherence in things capable of being spoken of as either the same or different is not capable of being spoken of as either the same or different. Those in whom that exists are not capable of being spoken of as either the same or different. By the negation of that, in the absence of things not capable of being spoken of as either the same or different, there is no Inherence. This is a false criticism, because the definition serves to distinguish what exists. For if what does not exist were produced by the definition, this criticism would be valid, that of things not capable of being spoken of as either the same or different. But when Inherence is not produced by the definition, in the absence of things capable of being spoken of as either the same or different, there is no absence of things not capable of being spoken of as either the same or different, so the definition is impossible.

Its primacy is due to the fact that it enjoins the instruction everywhere. Instruction is the mere mention of categories by their names. And since definition and examination are present only in universals etc., they are mentioned by implication. Or, thinking that liberation comes from the knowledge of categories like substance, and considering it to be a great deception if liberation were to be obtained merely by the knowledge of their instruction, the resident disciple might turn away from hearing. In order to reassure him, the statement is made: Thus, the instruction of the categories alone without their properties is done, not their definition or examination. The knowledge of similarity and dissimilarity through them is heard.

Because existence and so on are also the basis of uncommon properties. For thus existence is distinguished from being expressible, and being expressible is distinguished from existence. And if it is argued that exclusion is not possible without contact with uncommon properties, therefore the determination is not possible as the basis of uncommon properties, that is not so. The definition of substance is: having action, having quality, being the inherent cause. The quality of being dependent on substance is for the exclusion of non-connection and other-connection. Similarly, the quality of motion is: being momentary, necessarily occurring in a corporeal substance. The universal is: being eternally one, yet presently existing in many through inherence. The quality of particularity is: occurring only in eternal substances, for the exclusion of non-connection and other-connection. Inherence is: the relation of inseparable inherence, necessarily.

Even in non-eternality, there is no absence of origination in qualities etc. because only the substance is the inherent cause, and because origination is accepted to be only from the instrumental cause like destruction. For example, the body consisting of substance, quality and action is seen to be produced from the inherent and other causes, but the opposite is from the instrumental cause alone. So are the dharmas. They originate only from the instrumental cause, because they are effects different from substance, quality and action. Whatever effect is different from substance, quality and action is seen to originate only from the instrumental cause. Like destruction. And the dharmas are effects different from substance, quality and action. Therefore, they originate only from the instrumental cause.

If it is argued that the relation of the five with inherence is dependence, and inherence exists in itself, then in that case it would be a repetition to say that the five are inherents. This is because inherence is the relation characterized by inherence, and that is said to be the dependence of the five by the word dependence.

Inherence is the existence of the dependent thing. This is not so.

Therefore, a secondary manifestation is accepted. And that, due to the impossibility of another cause, is itself the special manifestation of inherence, the cause of the knowledge of dependence.

Thus, the relation of qualifier and qualified is not dependent on conjunction or inherence, because in negation, that would lead to the absence of that. If it is the restriction of the cognition of the qualified, then where there is the cognition of the qualified, there is the relation of qualifier and qualified. There, because the cognition of the qualified arises even in universals etc., the relation is only the relation of qualifier and qualified.

Where the qualification of qualities, actions, and universals is accepted by both, it is seen there that they are related by inherence. In the case of universals etc., the absence of inherence, which is all-pervasive, leads to the absence of the qualified nature, which is pervaded by it. Thus, it is proper to superimpose existence based on the perception of a property co-occurring with it. Otherwise, there would be the destruction of figurative cognition everywhere and of false cognition. This is because, for example, in the statement The boy is a lion, lionhood is a qualifier even with respect to the boy. The cognition would be primary, as if it were a lion. Similarly, in the cognition Silver with respect to a mother-of-pearl, silverhood is a qualifier, as if it were silver. Thus, it would not be false.

Because there is no experience of lionhood inhering in the young boy, and similarly, no experience of silverness inhering in the shell. Therefore, the figurative usage of lionhood and silverness in the young boy and shell is appropriate as their operation is through attribution of what is remembered. Then, in the case of universals etc., the knowledge of being is being through the attribution of existence is proper, because the objection to the inherence of existence is applicable. But how can there be figurative usage in the knowledge of being is being in universals etc. due to the non-appearance of the word like there? For that knowledge is figurative where the word like is prominent. Otherwise, in the absence of distinction in attribution, there would be no distinction in false knowledge.

For thus, there is the usage impermanent objects are perishable. And if there were no other cause for the impermanent cognition, we would understand that existence indicated by both ends is a qualifier. Just as non-arising and destruction, even though non-existent, are in some way indicators of existence, so there is nothing contradictory in their being indicators of the existent thing as well.

No, because even the imagined difference performs a useful function, just as in the case of the ear. For the ear is the region of space characterized by the conjunction of the cavity of the ear, and that, even though it is an unreal difference, performs the useful function characterized by the apprehension of sound. In the same way, there is no fault in the case of inherence. Or the definition is the inherence of earthness, and earthness is related to that. Thus, by the inclusion of the karmadhāraya compound, inherence is related to that which is related to earthness.

It is only what is well known as existing that can be denied by means of the negative word; e.g. the ‘cook’ is denied in the sentence ‘the priest, not the cook, should be fed’, and on that account is regarded as excluded (by the negative). In the case in question however, there is no such well-known entity as ‘earth-universality’, which could be denied by means of the negative word; nor is any such entity created by the words of the sentence (in which the said denial occurs). Nor is Apoha itself admitted (by us); because it is not possible for it to be either manifested or distinguished. As regards the argument that “the word ‘cow’ is not found to be applied to the horse, etc. on the basis of the absence of the absence of the universal ‘cow’,—and that it is applied to the variegated cow and other particular cows,—this is explained as being due to the absence of the absence of the particular ‘cow’ in the variegated cow, etc. and to the presence of the universal ‘cow’ in the variegated cow, etc.” (see text 1022),—this also is not right. Because, in the case of the variegated cow, etc. also, the ‘exclusion of the non-cow’ is not admitted; because the ‘exclusion of the non-cow’ is of the nature of the ‘cow’, and this ‘cow’ is not admitted (by us). If the ‘exclusion of the non-cow’ were of the nature of the ‘cow’, then, in that case, the ‘cow’ would have to be admitted; as the ‘exclusion of the non-cow’ would be of the nature of the ‘cow’. If the ‘exclusion of the non-cow’ were not of the nature of the ‘cow’, then it could not be the ‘exclusion of the non-cow’; as it would not be of the nature of the ‘cow’. Thus then, the ‘exclusion of the non-cow’ being not admitted, the ‘cow’ also cannot be admitted; as it is dependent upon that. Thus the

And the non-yogic person cannot perceive all the particulars. And without the perception of these, there can be no idea of the restriction that ‘this is denoter’ and ‘that is denoted’, or of the relation of Name and Named. And without the idea of the Convention, there can be no idea of the meaning of the word, on the hearing of the word. If, lastly, the Convention is made in regard to the Particulars, on the basis of a common property, that also cannot be right. Even though the common property may be there, the Particulars do not cease to be infinite in number; so that the Convention could only be in regard to the Common Property, and the denotation of the word would consist in the Common Property.

When the cause is non-different, the word-meaning has the universal, because of the reason for the convention. Just as the particulars exist eternally. For thus, the non-different universal is perceived in them. By the perception of that, even the particulars that are not perceived have the universal. And the words are the objects of the convention, even though they are impermanent, they are accompanied by a particular sequence. For thus, wherever you see such a universal, there that word should be used. And from a word of such a nature, this meaning should be understood. And the grasping of the convention is possible even in the infinitude of particulars. And thus, the understanding of the meaning with the universal is seen from hearing the word. And that implies the understanding of the convention. And the convention is possible in this very way, not otherwise.

But it is not that after conveying the qualifier, it does not denote the qualified. Similarly, having performed the division of action, it makes the subsequent conjunction, because there is no destruction of what has not been conjoined.

The refutation of that is stated in the verse beginning with śūnya. What is meant is that because it is related to earthness, earth produces an effect. Earthness itself is its own potency, while the other is in the form of the final cooperating factor. Because it produces an effect when that exists, and because it does not produce an effect when it does not exist. This is because, even though the threads exist, they do not produce an effect without the final conjunction of the threads. That itself is the potency. If it is an entirely different thing, how can it be the potency of an entirely different thing? Even if it is not entirely different, this is the same. That itself is the potency of that very thing. Now, if the potency of the previous ones is only the final cooperating factor, and that also is not able to produce the effect, another potency must be stated. Thus there is an infinite regress.

Whose obstruction is it? Not of fire, nor of the contact of fire, which is perceived. Therefore, the obstruction is of power. That is wrong. Because the absence of the obstruction by gem, mantra, etc. is also a contributory cause in the production of the effect. But in its absence, the effect does not arise. Therefore, the power is only the contact qualified by that. And it is not possible for power to be obstructed, not produced, or destroyed. Because of being produced long ago and being destroyed, there is no cause for its further production, so it would not be produced. Because that which is powerless does not produce effects. Thus, by positive and negative concomitance, it is known that the contact of fire qualified by the absence of the obstruction is the power of fire. Similarly, here also, earthness is one's own power, but another is a contributory cause.

If it is accepted that it arises from a variegated [cause], then it would follow absurdly that even in the causes of the causes of cloth, a variegated appearance would occur. But if it arises from an unvariegated [cause], then it would follow that everywhere, an unvariegated form would arise as a variegated form. This is not correct. It is observed that causes with various forms produce effects with various forms. And it is not so that in the causes of those [causes], various forms do not exist, so there is no arising of the variegated [effect]. And since the threads are related to many forms such as blue, there is nothing that obstructs the production of many forms even in the cloth. Because a form of that kind is produced by the quality of the cause, in the manner described earlier. Thus, it is reasonable that from each cause, even though the form is not variegated, blue arises from blue, and yellow from yellow.

This is refuted. By the word stability, stability, firmness, and non-falling are meant. If there were falling, due to the excess of gravity, the excess of falling would be perceived. Due to the earth's excessive falling, a clod thrown upwards would not be connected with the ground. This is because the clod's upward motion and slow return would result in a separation of a hundred yojanas or more due to the earth's rapid falling. Thus there would be no connection. But connection is seen, so it is known that the earth does not fall. It is precisely because of the impossibility of non-falling that it is known that there is something that supports gravity.

If the presence of fire were dependent on the presence of smoke, then the presence of smoke would not be possible without the presence of fire. If it is argued that the pervasion is uneven, and the pervasion is only that whatever has smoke has fire, but not that whatever has fire has smoke, then the reason because it has a particular arrangement of parts, which is present in a part of the similar instance, cannot be an invalid reason.

Due to their excellent deeds, their bodies are born from a womb. To avoid the mere negation of a cause, he says they are born from a womb, born from a cause. Then how are their bodies not born from a womb? He says they are not born from mother and father. The words mother and father are used figuratively to refer to blood and semen. Thus, excellent deeds are twofold: having the nature of Dharma and having the nature of non-Dharma. Among them, the bodies of divine sages are born from those having the nature of Dharma, and the bodies of small creatures and those undergoing punishment are born from those having the nature of non-Dharma. Small creatures are lice and so on. Bodies undergoing punishment are the bodies of hell beings. They are born from atoms accompanied by specific non-Dharma. Now, although the bodies of divine sages are born from specific Dharma, they are perceived as born from a womb by inference. For example, the bodies of divine sages are born from a womb because they are bodies, like our bodies. And that is not a valid means of knowledge because it is contradicted by scripture.

Excellent karma in the form of non-virtue is in the body of a sharabha, but in the body of a god or sage it is in the form of virtue. Even though there is a difference, being produced by excellent karma is not distinguished in both cases. Therefore the example is not devoid of the means of knowledge.

It is born from the union of semen and blood. Semen belongs to the father, and blood to the mother. At the time of their union, the enjoyer, due to the power of karma, becomes connected with the internal organ. From the union of semen and blood, a substance with a condensed form is produced. ... Then, due to the connection with the internal heat, action arises in the parts, depending on the impulse. After that, due to the separation, the conjunction that produces the substance is destroyed. Due to its destruction, the substance produced from it is destroyed. Again, from another contact with fire, the previous color and other properties cease. And from another, the production of the new color and other properties occurs. Thus, in the atoms produced by the ripening effect, action arises from the conjunction with the self, depending on unseen [forces]. It produces separation. From that, the previous conjunction ceases, and the subsequent conjunction produces the dyad. Thus, from the dyads, the triad is produced. In this way, the body is produced through the sequence of creation.

Because it would lead to the absurdity that all produced substances would exist in the atoms. Thus, a dyad is produced from two atoms. When it is not destroyed, it is again produced from those two together with another atom. It is again produced from those together with another atom. Thus there would be the absurdity of the coexistence of material substances in the same place. Thus, what is produced from two atoms exists in the atoms.

Even though the general terms are used in the sutra, they are implicitly indicated. Thus, only white form, sweet taste, and cold touch are in water.

Just as earth has the nature of atoms and is eternal, but has the characteristic of an effect and is non-eternal, so also water, he says, because of the existence of the eternal and non-eternal. By this, he shows the difference in the secondary divisions, that there are two kinds in the form of eternality and non-eternality. But it should be known that the effect, even though infinite, is of three kinds. By what form? He says, that which is known as body, sense organ, and object is said to be that.

Water is due to moisture. Fire is due to cooking. And space is due to expansion, i.e., to the particular arrangement of parts, by providing space. Thus, it is said to be composed of the five elements. But that is not correct. Because the inherence of things of different classes in a single substance is not seen. And the body is not perceived as inhering in parts of different classes. And if there were inherence of the five, then which part of earth would be different from water, fire, and air? The body would be perceived as inhering in them. But that is not so. And because the inherent causes have diverse properties, there would be diversity in the effect also. And in that case, in the earthy part, any one of the colors like white would be the color, and the touch produced by cooking would be there. And in the watery part, the color would be only white, and the touch would be only cold. And in the fiery part, the color would be luminous, and the touch would be only hot.

And in this acceptance, the production of form and so on would not occur. Thus, qualities produce another quality. In the sūtra qualities produce another quality, the production of many qualities by a quality is stated. And in this case, in a dyad produced from earth and water atoms, the production of smell would not occur. Because it is not a producer due to being one. Similarly, in a dyad produced from water and fire atoms, taste would not occur. Similarly, in a dyad produced from fire and air atoms, there would be no form.

But cooking is by the internal contact with fire. And that is never perceived by the sense in the body at all times.

The perception of taste is the effect of the instrument, because it is an action. Whatever is an action is the effect of an instrument, like the action of cutting. And this is such an action. Therefore, it is the effect of an instrument. And that which is the instrument that accomplishes the perception of taste is also water. It is the tongue, because it invariably manifests taste among form, taste, etc. Whatever invariably manifests taste among form, etc. is seen to be water, like the water inside the teeth. And this is so. Therefore, it is water. Since the apprehension of taste, etc. is also possible from the operation of the tongue, it would not be impossible. Therefore, the words among form, etc. are used. For example, when the throat is dry, the perception of taste in sweets, etc. is not perceived. But when water is present, the perception of taste alone among form, etc. is perceived. Thus, it exists in similar instances. And this is not possible in what is not water. Therefore, it is water.

And the presence of taste is the excellence of taste for the organ of taste. Even by a general word, the meaning is not stated, so taste is known by this, therefore the organ of taste.

The atomic particles of fire are the inherent cause, and their conjunction is the non-inherent cause. The parts of earth and so on are the instrumental cause. And that is established in the world of the sun by scripture. Now, if the body of fire is momentary, it does not produce the special enjoyment that arises from it. Therefore it is said: And it is capable of enjoyment because it is supported by the parts of earth.

The perception of form is the effect of the instrument, because it is an action. Whatever action is, that is the effect of the instrument, just as the action of cutting. And this is such an action. Therefore, it is the effect of the instrument. That which is the instrument that accomplishes the perception of form is the eye. And that is of the nature of fire, because it invariably manifests form among form and other sense objects. Whatever invariably manifests form among form and other sense objects is of the nature of fire, just as a lamp. And the eye invariably manifests form among form and other sense objects. Therefore, it is of the nature of fire. For if the eye were perceived as the illuminator of substances possessing form, its invariable manifestation of form would not be established. Therefore, the word among form and other sense objects is used. It is intended that the invariable manifestation of form among form, taste, smell, and touch is meant.

This is the commentary on that aphorism: The cognition of form is that by which form is cognized. The eye is the natural cause of its production. It is fire because of predominance. Therefore, the sense organ is the illuminator of form alone. For predominance means the state of being the cause of the combination of a majority of parts of fire, which are grasped by a special unseen force, with a few other parts. Or, the cognition of form is the knowledge of it. The eye is the cause of that alone among form and so on. Why? It says because of predominance, because of being evolved, and because it possesses form. For the possession of form is intended to be the excellence of form. Otherwise, because of being fiery, the possession of the quality of heat would also be possible, so the special mention would be meaningless.

Because it lacks the distinctive form of a lamp. For the perception of a substance possessing form is by both the eye and touch. But the distinctive form is the special co-operating factor, the form property called 'udbhava', due to which the perception of form occurs in some objects, and due to its absence, even a large substance composed of many parts is not perceived. And the absence of distinctive form is seen in the case of fire existing in water, even though it is large and composed of many substances. The lamp, which has manifest form, is perceived even in darkness. For the creation of things is for the sake of experience. If the eye were to perceive form even in darkness due to the manifestation of form, the experience of evil beings would not arise. Therefore, the eye, which has non-manifest form, is produced by Prajapati under the influence of unseen forces that bring about that experience. Similarly, even when the hot touch is manifested, the eye is produced by Prajapati under the influence of unseen forces that bring about that experience.

This is a specific dissimilarity of the object, which is distinguished from the body and senses by the definition of the object. Among them, what exists on the ground is terrestrial. For whom fuel itself is the fuel, from which it originates, that is said to originate from fuel, and is distinguished from other specific fuels. And that which has the nature of burning upwards is said to have the nature of burning upwards. It is distinguished from other things by this also. Even though the view that only what performs a function is ultimately real is accepted as existing through the relation of existence, the negation is for the sake of the doctrine of acceptance.

But if the non-specificity is intended, he would designate another effect as the offspring. Or, the specific understanding is from another scripture. That is enough. Similarly, because of the initial designation gold, the offspring of fire such as silver is also understood. Otherwise, first would be meaningless. The word first is not meaningless. It is meaningful because it excludes the subsequent silver and so on.

On account of the conjunction of the united. Thus, in gold, &c., there is a substance which is earthy, and is conjoined with it; and the taste, &c., inhering in that are perceived. He says, therefore, that the perception of taste, &c., is on account of the conjunction of the united. If, then, fluidity also be thus, let it be so; why is it a quality of fire? Because the difference of the earthy is perceived. Thus, the earthy, such as lac, &c., is seen to be reduced to ashes by contact with fire; and in gold, &c., even by a very great excess of contact with fire, there is only fluidity; and the non-appearance of the sensation of heat here is due to something unseen.

It possesses touch, number, dimension, separateness, conjunction, disjunction, priority, posteriority, and inherence. Touch is established in it as a quality not hot or cold, being produced by cooking, because it is included in qualities. Number and so on are seven, because it is said to be without form and invisible. Inherence is said to be of two kinds, because it is the cause of atoms and effects. Among them, the characteristic of an effect is fourfold: body, sense organ, object, and life. There, the body is born only from wind atoms endowed with special qualities in the world of winds, and it is capable of experience because it is supported by earthly constituents. The sense organ is the skin sense organ, which pervades the body and is produced by wind constituents not overwhelmed by earth and so on, and it perceives touch for all living beings. The object is the basis for perceived touch, characterized by touch, sound, support, vibration, and horizontal movement, and it has the nature of moving horizontally, supporting clouds and so on, and so on.

Air is the statement of the object to be defined, and because of the connection with airness is the definition. The connection with airness is the inherence characterized by airness. Inherence cannot be the definition due to over-extension, so the word airness is used. And airness, if unrelated, cannot be the inferential mark due to being a property of the subject, so the word connection is used to indicate the property of the subject. Thus, air is distinguished from other things by airness, because of the connection with airness. But those that are not distinguished are not connected with airness, like earth and so on. And air is not unconnected with airness in that way. Therefore, it is distinguished from other things. Or, the usage is to be established. And the remaining criticism and defense of the definition should be known in the section on earth. Thus, the word air has a general meaning, to indicate this, the word air is used.

No, because of not understanding the meaning of the sutra. And the meaning of the sutra is as follows: When the existence of non-obstructed knowledge is present, the entire and individual characteristics should be known. For where there is non-obstructed knowledge, these entire and individual characteristics have the nature of a cause. Thus, the self is perceptible just because of its greatness. But the wind is perceptible because of its greatness and because of being composed of many substances. And where there is knowledge of a substance by both the eye and touch, there the entire characteristic is present. But the predominance should be accepted according to what is seen. For thus, fire is perceived even from a distance at night because of the excellence of form. Even though it is great and composed of many substances, a mountain and so on are not perceived. So form is predominant. Similarly, even from a distance, a mountain and so on are perceived when there is light. But in greatness, it is to be inferred that it is of little importance.

But what is the evidence for its not being produced by cooking? Because it is devoid of the color etc. produced by cooking. For thus, the touch produced by cooking is seen to be accompanied by the color etc. produced by cooking in a pot etc. If this [touch of water] were also produced by cooking, it would exist in that way. But if it exists, it is not perceived because it is not manifest. That is not so, because it does not exist elsewhere. For even when the touch produced by cooking is perceived, the complete non-perception of color etc. is not seen elsewhere. And here, there is no evidence for the existence of color etc., so the experience is not possible. Because it is possible to imagine that [color etc.] do not manifest even when they exist. But if it is asked what is the evidence for their non-existence, it is only complete non-perception. For thus, it is possible for the substratum of the intended touch to be devoid of weight, so the co-occurring color etc. are never perceived by valid means of knowledge, so they do not exist.

But since the difference from that is not perceived from the sound produced by the disjunction, the qualification being different from that is doubtful. No, because the disjunction of the cause of those which have color etc. and are composed of dense parts is found to be the cause of the origin of sound, and its absence is undisputed. Therefore, because it is not produced by disjunction, the sound of the parrot etc. would not be perceived simultaneously with the shaking of the branches etc. But that is seen.

Otherwise, if one has less speed, it would be overcome by the stronger one, and there would be no 'sammūrchana'. For thus, when moving in the same direction, there is no 'sammūrchana'.

It is said that is also inferred from the upward movement of grass etc. Indeed, the upward movement of grass etc. is not logically possible due to their insentience.

Because that also, being the substratum of gravity, would require a different cause for upward movement, devoid of gravity. And here, the upward movement of grass etc. is not due to the conjunction of fire with its nature of burning upwards, because upward burning is not possible due to the absence of a particular fuel, and because that is not perceived. And since the operation of anything else here is not perceived, it is known that the upward movement of grass etc. is due to their connection with air.

For thus, creation is obtained before dissolution, and after that, dissolution; thus it has no beginning. And how does that dissolution occur? He says: From the separation of the atoms that are the causes of the body and senses due to the actions born from the conjunction of the soul with Mahesvara, when the conjunctions cease, there is destruction of those up to the atoms. When the conjunctions that are the causes of the substances that compose those bodies and senses cease, there is destruction of the dyads composed of them. He says: From the separation of the atoms that are the causes of the body and senses due to the actions born from the conjunction of the soul with Mahesvara, there is destruction up to the atoms. The cessation of the conjunctions that are the causes of substances is due to the separations of its own causes, the atoms. And those are due to the actions born from the conjunction of the soul with Mahesvara. For thus, the will of Mahesvara is the instrumental cause.

It is a particular time characterized by the absence of the unseen that brings about cessation. Because the effect is produced when that exists. Indeed, when the Brahmic year is not complete, due to the existence of the unseen that obstructs the attainment of cessation, creation does not occur even when the unseen that brings about experience exists. But when the year is complete, due to the absence of the special unseen, it is known that time, which is characterized by the absence of the obstruction, is the activity of the unseen that brings about experience, for the creation of those.

That is not so. Because His existence is established by inference and scripture. And thus the inference: The creation and dissolution of earth etc. are preceded by an agent. If it is argued that there is no inference because creation and dissolution are not known to exist in elements, that is not so, because they are established by having arrangement. Thus, earth etc. are effects, because they have arrangement. Whatever has arrangement is an effect, like a pot etc. Earth etc. have such arrangement. Therefore, they are effects.

Thus, smoke would also not be a reason, because the presence of fire is observed even without it. If it is argued that the pervasion is that where there is smoke, there is fire, then the same applies to the pervasion that where there is arrangement, there is being a product. And in that case, the non-apprehension by perception of the property of coming into existence after not having existed is proved by arrangement alone even in the case of a pot, and the same applies to dissolution.

When the substratum of consciousness is to be established as the controller, there is no absence of the probandum in the probans, nor is it contradictory. And causality does not deviate from the intelligent controller. Therefore, by the power of perception of invariable concomitance, it establishes the controller as capable of producing earth etc. in the subject. And one who is not aware of the material and instrumental causes of earth etc. is not capable of producing earth etc. Therefore, knowledge of atoms etc. is inferred for the creator. And it is seen that all inference, operating by the power of grasping the universal pervasion, establishes the particular probandum by the power of the property of the subject. And even if the opponent shouts loudly, the contradiction of the universal pervasion of being produced and being an effect in relation to the substratum of consciousness cannot be established. But if it is not established due to the absence of pervasion in the particular, then smoke also would not be an establisher.

Because that [contrary inference] would be subject to the fallacy of having an unestablished basis. And this is the same in the case of other reasons for denying God.

But that is seen. If, on the other hand, it is accepted that the body is all-pervading, eternal, and imperceptible, due to the production of an effect which is not restricted to a particular place, that is not so. Because it is contrary to what is seen. And it must be accepted that the one without a body is the agent. Because it is not possible for the body to be eternal. That body is to be accomplished by that [agent]. So what is begun without another body? If another body is accepted, it is accomplished by one connected with another body. In the succession of bodies, the Lord would be exhausted, and no other effect would appear. If it is argued that the body itself is the agent of the body, and that is not contradicted even at the time of the effect, if that is so, then at the time of dissolution when the body is destroyed, and the one without a body is not the agent at the beginning of creation again, the effect would not be produced. Thus it is accepted that the one without a body is the agent.

The fact of being an effect is pervaded by having a maker in general. Because the pervasion by an intelligent being is perceived, it is established even on earth. And it has been said that all inference proceeds depending on the apprehension of the pervasion elsewhere in general. It is not possible for any inference to depend on the apprehension of the pervasion in the subject. Therefore this is not a fault. It is not observed that the effect such as earth is pervaded by a maker. And it should not be said that there is no inference because an effect of this kind, which is not absent from the maker, is not observed. Because it would lead to the absurdity of the cessation of all inference. For instance, impermanence is accepted as being pervaded by being produced in sound. Here too it can be said that the being produced which is in sound is not observed elsewhere as invariably concomitant with impermanence, so there is no inference. If it is argued that when the pervasion of being produced and impermanence is apprehended elsewhere in general, there is inference, not in the subject, the same applies to the inference of God.

Even if action operates in the body and senses under the control of a conscious being, the existence of God is established. And the existence of the effect is also established. Even if action is produced by a conscious being alone, still its being a property of the self is not due to consciousness itself. And it is not identical with consciousness, because it will be said to be a property of the self. Nor is this analogous to the inference of origination from a single branch.

For when a lute is being played, the sound of the lute, though existing, is not perceived due to being overwhelmed by the sound of the donkey, but is seen to be perceived again when the overpowerer is absent.

For example, when something is understood by verbal testimony, it may be desired to be known by inference also. When it is understood by inference, it may be by perception. Similarly, in perception also, when something is perceived by one sense organ, it may be by another sense organ. Similarly, when many means of knowledge operate on an object that is a means to happiness, the purpose is the excess of happiness.

However, in relation to the universal, even pleasure etc. are apprehensible by another self, so the reason is inconclusive. This is not so. Sound is produced by one self, but is apprehended by another as well. But pleasure etc. are not like that. For instance, one sound-individual is produced by a very strong blow, pervading a large part of space, and is thus perceived by many.

Thus, sound is not a quality of space, time, or mind, because it is the mark of the possessor as a quality.

Similarly, the words simultaneously, etc., and the words east, west, etc., are the mark of those two because they are qualified by them, but they are the inferrers of another substratum as a quality.

Therefore, by elimination, it is a quality that becomes the means of knowing and defining space. But elimination is the exclusion of what is not possible elsewhere when what is possible is negated. Thus, the proof is sufficient to establish the object by the invariable concomitance of the vyatireka (negative concomitance). For example, sound is dependent on a substance other than earth, water, fire, air, space, time, self, and mind, because it is a quality, when there is an authoritative means of knowledge that contradicts its being a quality of those. But that which is not dependent on a substance other than those, and is not a quality of those when there is an authoritative means of knowledge that contradicts its being a quality of those, like form and so on, sound is not like that. Therefore, sound is dependent on a substance other than those. Thus, space is established. Is it one or many? He says: Singularity is established due to the non-distinction of sound as the mark. For sound is the mark of space, indicating it without distinction, not teaching multiplicity.

Thus, the variety of effects cannot be without the variety of causes. Therefore, the various words distinguished by intensity etc. must have a variegated cause itself. Thus, the establishment of plurality is based on that. And if the variety of effects is accepted even without the variety of causes, then even the fourfoldness of atoms would not be possible.

Even due to the variety of cooperating factors, the variety of sound is observed, so its substratum is not manifold. And thus, from the strongest impact, the sound is strongest, and from the weakest, the weakest, and so on. And it cannot be said that this should be so even in the case of earth etc. For there, the four kinds of effect are seen to arise from the material cause, which is mutually exclusive, so the atoms of that class are understood to be of four kinds only. But the variety of effects is due to the variety of the assemblage itself. There, in some cases, there is a difference in the cause, in some cases, a difference in the action, and in some cases, of another. This should be understood as appropriate. Here, it is true that the variety of sound is possible even due to the difference in the cause, so there is no difference from the inherent cause. This is because the non-establishment of plurality is due to the absence of the specific mark of sound.

When the existence of number is established by substance itself, oneness is established due to the absence of a means of knowledge for plurality. Thus, after number, dimension, which has come to the occasion, is abandoned, and disjunction is defined in violation of the sequence, why is it asked? Because it is subordinate to that. Subordination is association, for where there is oneness, there is necessarily one disjunction. But in this way, there is no subordination to dimension. Thus, where there is oneness, there is necessarily one disjunction, this is subordination to the particular. And in this way, where there is oneness, there is necessarily atomicity or grossness, there is no subordination to the particular. Thus, disjunction is defined first.

He says: from the statement of abundance. From abundance, space is great, and so is the self. From the absence of that, the mind is small. The aphorism shows: From abundance, the cause, space is great. By the general term, its highest magnitude is implied. For thus, the highest magnitude of an all-pervading substance is established in the self and so on. Here also, it is proved thus: Space is of highest magnitude. Because it is all-pervading. Like the self. And when all non-pervading things are made the subject, it is an inference of mere negative concomitance. When it is said that space and so on up to the self have highest magnitude because of being all-pervading, the negative concomitance is: those that do not have highest magnitude are not all-pervading.

The connection with all existing things. But others think that omnipresence is the inherence of all produced sounds in space, with full intensity when it exists. Or it is proved that it has supreme greatness, because it is a permanent substance not having atomic dimension. Thus, it shows the aphorism Sound arises from conjunction and disjunction, because it is mentioned as the cause of sound. For thus, conjunction and disjunction are the non-inherent cause of sound production, so inherence in space is obtained from this statement. Otherwise, there would be no non-inherent cause due to the absence of proximity. And there is no other non-inherent cause. Since space is thus a substance having qualities, it is a substance like an atom, because it has qualities and is not dependent.

It is eternal, because there is no cause either homogeneous or heterogeneous. For instance, there is no homogeneous cause, because Ākāśa is one only. Nor is there any heterogeneous cause, in the shape of the non-homogeneous Inherence; because there is absence of the homogeneous cause, there is absence of the Conjunction also. And without the homogeneous and heterogeneous causes, the production of an entity in the shape of the effect is not possible. Hence, on account of its not being an effect, Ākāśa is eternal. And for this reason, it is the cause, the means, of the perception of sound by all living beings. Even though Ākāśa is one only, it shows the character of doing many things. And Ākāśa is not the cause of the perception of sound by mere existence; because if it were so, then there would be the incongruity of the perception of sound everywhere, by all living beings, without any distinction. And because there is no distinction in the Inherence of all sounds in Ākāśa, therefore it is said that it is the cause of the perception of sound by becoming the Auditory Organ.

Even though the sounds are in the same substratum as the contact with the cavity of the ear, still they are not grasped due to the absence of a specific proximity.

In the performance of many agents, the attainment of many effects occurs simultaneously. For instance, it is seen that the cognition with reference to the agent is They are performing simultaneously, and the cognition with reference to the effect is These have been produced simultaneously. And here, the reference is not merely to the agent or merely to the effect, because that would lead to an absurdity. For instance, even where the effect occurs sequentially, the agent and object are present there too. It may be said that this is consciousness, and it is not known that consciousness arises with reference to a distinguished agent or effect, thinking This is consciousness. And that which is the distinguishing factor, different from earth etc., is time. Thus, sequence is not due to simultaneity or non-simultaneity. The cognition with reference to the agent is They are performing non-simultaneously, and the cognition with reference to the effect is These have been produced non-simultaneously. Even here, since the reference is to the distinguished agent and object, a cause different from earth etc. must be stated, thus establishing time.

There, the notion of done slowly and done quickly implies a different cause due to being different. And the effect cannot be the cause, because it is the same in both cases. Nor can the agent alone be the cause, because that is also common to both. And something cannot occur without a cause. Therefore, there must be a different cause. Hence he says: Of those notions of simultaneity, etc., regarding objects, agents, and effects, what are the specific features? They are different from previous notions. Previous notions are about agents and effects. They are different from those. Since the origination of something else, such as earth, etc., is impossible, that which is the cause is time.

Similarly, when fire is inferred, it is cognized as qualified by fireness, so there must be prior apprehension of fireness. There also, if fire is the qualifier, there is mutual dependence. If the inherence of fireness in fire is the analysis, then there also fireness or fire is the qualifier, so the same fault remains. Since it is present everywhere without distinction, it cannot be a qualifier. If the mountain is the qualifier of fire, then there also mountainness and inherence there are the qualifiers, so the fault remains as before. If the conjunction of fire with the mountain is the qualifier of both fire and the mountain, then that also has two conjoined objects, and they also have conjunction, so the previous fault arises.

Thus, having perceived the odour by the nose, the substance by the eye or by the touch, one subsequently connects them by the mind, as ‘the fragrant substance.’ And it cannot be said that every cognition of the qualified is the cognition of the connection; because in that case there would be no occurrence of the contradiction. Similarly, in the case of the relation of qualification and qualified, the object of the different cognitions, there would be no recollection in the form ‘I saw the man with the stick,’ because that (recollection) is of the nature of experience.

And that would not be the case if there were only one cognition as the object, because both are objects. Nor would there be a distinction from the eye, etc., because of the non-distinction in the function of assisting in the unknown. Therefore, its cognition is imagined. And if the stick qualified by stickness is accepted as the qualifier of the man, that also would have another, so there would be an infinite regress. And if the stick were the qualifier of stickness, there would be mutual dependence, and there would be the consequence of the absence of the cognition of the qualified.

For the form of the qualifier does not appear in the stick as stick-ness and so on. If the being a qualifier consists in producing a cognition connected with itself, and that consists in producing a cognition of the qualified along with a cognition of itself as its object, then there is contradiction of your own doctrine. And we do not see the purpose of connection in being the object of a single cognition, since the designation by the word that and so on is denied. Nor is the order the cause of the relation of qualifier and qualified, because it is not accepted. But the knowledge of the qualified does indeed show the knowledge of the qualifier, otherwise, because of the impossibility of being qualified by that. And as for this, that the result of perception is the non-apprehension by inference, that is wrong, because here the acceptance of being the object of a single cognition is due to the existence of a contradiction.

Similarly, the effect like a flower is perceived at a fixed time, not at another time. By positive and negative concomitance, its causal nature is understood. For instance, the appearance of flowers like the pāṭala occurs only in the spring season, not at another time. In this way, it should be inferred in other effects as well. Similarly, the usage it depends on the time of birth indicates the causal nature of time.

To remove that doubt, he says that oneness is established due to the non-distinction of time and gender. That which is the gender of time, in the form of the cognition of simultaneity, etc., is distinguished by that, and does not indicate multiplicity. But this is not established, because the cognitions of simultaneity, etc. are distinguished from each other, and difference in effect does not occur without difference in cause. Therefore, multiplicity is reasonable. True, but the difference in effect itself indicates the difference in the assemblage [of causes], and that is possible even by the inclusion of another cooperating cause. How then is time multiple? And it has been said here that that which is accumulated by distinguished action produces distinguished cognitions. And thus the tetrad of atoms is not contradicted, as before. Thus, oneness is established because of the absence of evidence for multiplicity and because substance is countable.

Diversity is due to their distinction. Thus, the future time is characterized by the beginning and action. The present is characterized by that, i.e., accomplishment, which is the attainment of self. Similarly, continuance, which is the performance of many effects in succession, is also characterized by that, i.e., the present itself.

He says: like a gem or like a cook. Just as a gem, without abandoning its own nature, is figuratively spoken of as diverse due to the difference of limiting adjuncts, as yellow, red, etc., so here also, the difference of present, etc. is due to the difference of limiting adjuncts in the form of different actions.

For in real difference, the occurrence of contradiction is possible. Thus, if the difference of the present, etc. were real and all-pervading, then the inexpressibility of a single entity in relation to many times would result. For it cannot be expressed as present, because it is related to the past and future also. Nor can it be expressed as past, because it is related to the other two also. Then, in the case of a single person, the cognitions of the past, future and present would not be possible in a single place. But they are seen to be so.

This is not so. Because in mutual dependence, both would be non-existent. For if the notion of west depends on the notion of east, and the notion of east depends on the notion of west, then in the absence of one, the other would be absent, leading to the absence of both. And it is not without cause, because it arises sometimes. And by positive and negative concomitance, the operation of corporeal substances is observed. And because of designation by finger, etc., it is the object. And that, being undifferentiated, does not operate in the production of notions, because in all cases, without distinction, the notions of east, etc., would be undifferentiated.

For, in its being the cause, if the previous condition is in the east, then the conditions in the south etc. would also be there, because there is no difference. Nor is convention itself the cause, because without a cause it does not operate everywhere. For, the word 'east', signified by a single cause, does not occur in another meaning.

The supreme greatness is stated by the sentence The directions are the cause of the notions of east, west, etc. Thus, the notions of east, west, etc. are not possible everywhere without a cause. Therefore, the directions have supreme greatness due to their all-pervasiveness. Similarly, the east and west directions are established by the sutra The east and west are due to the proximity and remoteness of the cause. Thus, the proximity of the cause to the east is the conjunction that produces the east direction, and the proximity of the cause to the west is the conjunction that produces the west direction. We will explain this in the examination of the east and west directions. And since conjunction is necessarily perishable due to being produced, and since the destruction of the substratum is not possible everywhere, it is established that conjunction is destroyed by disjunction. This is the meaning of the extension. Similarly, it should be seen that the directions are substances because they possess qualities and are not dependent on anything else, and are eternal because causes of the same and different kinds are not possible, and therefore are not effects.

For thus, the self is distinguished from the other, because of the connection with the nature of the self. But that which is not distinguished from the other, the non-self, and is not connected with the nature of the self, like earth etc., is not so. And the self is not so. Therefore, it is distinguished. Or the usage is to be established. Thus, the sentence should be connected as before, with the purpose of determining the meaning of the word.

For example, the body is devoid of the sentience imagined by others, because it is an element and because it is an effect.

Because the living body is controlled by an effortful controller, because it is the substratum of engagement and disengagement capable of attaining the beneficial and avoiding the harmful inherent in the living body, like a chariot.

For the chariot does not have the substratum of action inhering in the living body. If it is argued that action is that which is fit for attaining the beneficial and avoiding the harmful, inhering in the living body, and is produced by effort, because it is a particular kind of action, like the action of a chariot, then even here the qualified reason does not exist in the sapaksa. Similarly, when a person is asleep and not riding, the action with the stated qualifications is not the cause of attaining the intended object, nor the cause of avoiding the harmful. And it is not a fallacy, saying it is produced by effort. Therefore, the reason is the substratum of action that conforms to desire. For example, the living body is controlled by effort, because it is the substratum of action that conforms to desire, like a substance, like a chariot. Or action is produced by effort, because it is action that conforms to desire, like the action of a chariot.

He says: Because of the observation of modified action in the air enclosed in the body, like one blowing a bellows, it is inferred. This establishes the pervasion. The argument is: The living body is controlled by an effortful being, because it is the substratum of modified air enclosed in the living body, like a bellows. The word 'modified' is used because others also have air as their substratum. Modification is the upward and downward movement of the air that moves horizontally. Still, the air moving upward is obstructed by another air, so the word 'enclosed' is used. For thus, in a hollow tree, the air entering through the hole can move upward and downward.

If it be said that if the soul cannot be the bestower of any excellence on experience, then it cannot be spoken of as the experiencer, we say no; because it is itself the excellence. And the non-existence of that (soul) prior to experience is non-excellence, and is removed. It has been said before that the completeness of the causal factors is excellence, and their incompleteness is non-excellence. And when there is no difference, excellence cannot be conceived. So much for the detailed discussion.

Hence the co-ordination (in the notion of ‘I’) can only be figurative, based upon the qualities of the Body. As a matter of fact, the co-ordination is actually found in the form of ‘I am the rememberer’, in the case of the cognition of remembrance; and it has been already pointed out that the remembrance is not present in the Body. For the following reason also the feelings of Pleasure, etc. cannot be the qualities of the Body or of the Sense-organs: because they are restricted in their manifestation; while the qualities of the Body, such as Colour, etc. are all-pervading. For instance, the feelings of Pleasure, etc. are not present in the Body as a whole, nor in its parts, nor in the Sense-organs; because they are never perceived as such. Nor is there any other substratum of these feelings, apart from the Body and the Sense-organs. For these reasons, the feelings of Pleasure, etc. cannot be the qualities of the Body and the Sense-organs. Nor can the Reason be regarded as ‘Inconclusive’ on the ground of the possibility of the qualities of the Body, etc. being restricted in their manifestation; because the qualities of the Body, such as Colour, etc. are all-pervading. Nor can the Reason be regarded as ‘Contradictory’; because it is present in all cases where the Probandum is known to be present. Nor can the Reason be regarded as ‘Inadmissible’; because it has been already established that the feelings of Pleasure, etc. are not present in the Body, nor in the Sense-organs, nor in their contact, nor in the Soul.

The word 'I' is external. Because of the unobstructed single word, it necessarily requires what is to be denoted.

If again the word 'I' were to denote the object 'earth' etc., there would be co-reference with that word, as in 'I am earth, I am water' etc. But this is not seen. Therefore, it is proper that the word 'I' occurs only with reference to the self. For a word occurring in a different context does not denote a different meaning.

This aphorism is for the purpose of removing the doubt that arises from this. Because the qualities of one self are not the causes of the qualities of another self, and Dharma and Adharma are the qualities of the self, they cannot be the cause of the production of the qualities of another self.

And this is not found to be the case. Therefore, recognition, which is concomitant with oneness, being absent in the case of the bodies of the horse, the buffalo and so on, sets aside the concomitance, and so there is diversity. Thus, in the case of the bodies of the horse, the buffalo and so on, the soul, the subject, is diverse by reason of the difference of individuals, while being the soul, is the conclusion. Because, when the other body is perceived, there is no recognition of the object by the other body. And where there is one, there is recognition, as in the case of the bodies of childhood, youth and old age. This is the negative concomitance.

But those that are contrary to it depend on exclusion. If it is argued that this appearance of difference is superimposed by ignorance, it is not so, because that is not possible apart from the self. But if there is difference, there is the cessation of oneness. And if ignorance were of the form of the cessation of knowledge, how could it, being of the nature of emptiness, generate the usage of difference? And the appearance of difference is not illusory due to the impossibility of contradiction. Nor is it proper for imagined forms to generate real effects. But in the case of the rope, the real effect of eating and running is produced only from the real snake, not from the imagined object.

And just as there is no means of knowledge for the oneness of everything, so also there would be diversity. The absence of means of knowledge is the same in both cases.

Now, if these things are distinct from the Supreme Self, how do they manifest? Because what is not manifest cannot manifest. If they do manifest, they are not distinct from the Supreme Self, because He alone is of the nature of light. If this is argued, it is not so. Because they are cognized by the means of valid knowledge such as perception, which are related to different forms, their luminous nature is related to the nature of existence. Or it may be of the nature of consciousness. But that is not possible in objects. So, due to non-existence, the Supreme Self would also be non-existent, because the existence of the form of another object in another object is not distinguished. And if there were only one Self, when it is liberated in one place, it would be so everywhere. So liberation would be accomplished without effort. Similarly, when one is not liberated, others would also not be liberated. So there would be the undesirable consequence of the non-liberation of all.

Or the eye and so on depend on a cause that acts in succession, because even when they exist, they produce the effect in succession. For one who produces an effect in succession even when existing, necessarily depends on a cause that acts in succession. For example, a hand with a knife and a cutting board.

In the same way, the eyes and other sense organs, when controlled by the Self, produce their effects in succession, in relation to the objects, and thus require a cause that operates in succession. Similarly, the fact that memory arises even when the ear and other sense organs are not functioning shows that there is another instrument. For example, memory is produced by an instrument, because it is an action, like the action of cutting. And the ear etc. are not the instrument, because memory is seen to arise even when they are not functioning. That which arises even when something is not functioning is not the effect of that, just as a pot that arises when the threads are destroyed. But memory arises even when the ear etc. are not functioning in the deaf etc., so it is not their effect. Therefore, it must be produced by another instrument.

Similarly, for a teacher, efforts arise simultaneously in speaking, walking, searching for a path, and holding a water pot. This is not established. That is not so, because there are no well-known examples of simultaneity. The notion of simultaneity should be seen as arising from the rapid occurrence, like the notion of the perforation of a hundred lotus petals. But in the case of succession, there are many well-known examples. Therefore, it is reasonable that cognitions arise only in succession, because the mind, which has atomic dimensions, comes into contact with the sense organs only in succession. Even if it is accepted that the mind, though having atomic dimensions, is many in one body, some sense organ would be controlled by some mind, and there would be simultaneity of cognitions. But cognitions arising in succession are experienced. Therefore, the mind is one, having atomic dimensions, in each body. And even so, the eye is not controlled by the mind.

Thus, the parts of the axe that are related to the grass and depend on velocity are indeed different from each other. This is not correct. Because only that axe which is related to the action is the instrument. Otherwise, since the difference in the relation of the eye is also possible due to the difference in the related objects, those [parts of the axe] would also be the instrument. And because they are controlled by the mind through the eye, there would be the undesirable consequence of the simultaneous arising of the knowledge of the pot etc. But this is not so. Because it is not experienced. Therefore, the simultaneous illumination of the pot etc. is not their apprehension. It is proper that the eye is the instrument related to many objects.

Moving away and moving towards are caused by unseen forces, such as the conjunctions of food and drink and other actions. The sutra shows this. But moving away is an action for the purpose of disjunction from the dead body, and moving towards is for the purpose of conjunction with the body in front.

Because it is seen that the connection of a substance of the same class produces a substance except in the case of the ultimate atom, he says: It does not produce a substance because it is without touch. For it is seen that a substance with touch produces a substance, like the atoms. And there is no evidence that the mind has touch. Because a product with touch of the same class as the mind is not perceived. For just as when a product with touch of the class of earth is perceived, it indicates the presence of touch in the atoms that produce it, so there is no such product of the class of mind. How then can the mind have touch?

And what is well-known is seen to be excluded by a particular, as in not blue by blue. Thus, color etc. are different from the other, or they should be spoken of as qualities, because of the relation of quality.

And that is intended to be qualified. Otherwise, since substance etc. are also dependent on substance, the common property would be too broad. It is not excluded. But the qualification is that dependence is only on substances. The qualities, actions and universals are dependent only on substances, not on qualities etc. But the universals and inherence are dependent on substances, but not only on substances, because they exist in qualities etc. also. But the qualities are dependent only on substances, not on qualities etc. Similarly, they are only dependent on substances, not independent. Because a qualityless substance is not perceived. Thus, by the exclusion of non-connection and connection with others, it is to be proved that they differ from the others because of their dependence on substance.

Because only substance is the inherent cause, and those [form, etc.] do not arise as their substrata. If it is argued that the inherent forms, etc. have arising, so it is proper that they are the inherent causes, that is not so. Because of non-apprehension.

And the color of the cause itself is not the non-inherent cause, because that [color of the cause] is the inherent cause in the production of color belonging to itself. And it is not seen that the same thing is both the inherent cause and the non-inherent cause. Nor is conjunction [the non-inherent cause], because in the production of substance, it is not an inherent cause. And if the conjunction of threads is the non-inherent cause in the production of that [cloth], then before the production of that [cloth], there would be no such [conjunction]. Even if conjunction is the cause in the case of colors, the absence of that [conjunction] before the production of that [color] must be stated.

If it is being dependent on one, it would also apply to heaviness etc. If it is being grasped by each sense organ, it would not apply to oiliness, fluidity, virtue, vice etc. If it is being uncommon, that is not so. Because the universal of color etc. is perceived in many. If it is meant to be the individual, it exists even in heaviness etc. No, because it is logically possible otherwise. Thus, the specific qualities are those that, while being qualified by the particulars inhering in themselves, distinguish their substrata from those of the same class, because the distinction of the mere substratum is not possible. The word 'their substratum' is used. Even then, since color etc. without any qualification does not distinguish the substratum, the word 'qualified by a particular' is used. Number etc. also distinguish earth when inhering in the same substance as smell, and water when inhering in the same substance as oiliness. To exclude those, the word 'inhering in itself' is used. For example, the qualification whiteness inheres in color, and sweetness in taste.

Similarly, virtue and vice would produce pleasure, pain etc. immediately after the part of the self enclosed by themselves, so there would be absence of those in the abodes of heaven etc. But they do produce pleasure, pain etc. even in other abodes, so they are only instrumental causes.

For instance, in a pot full of water, there is necessarily an action in the region of the neck due to the connection with a fast-flowing perforated substance. And that action, having arisen, produces the disjunction which is the opposite of the conjunction that produces the substance. This is established by perception. Therefore, when there is destruction of the conjunction, there is cessation of the substance produced from it.

And if that is so, and it is argued that the effect like a pot is produced by atoms, then because the intermediate effect is not produced, it would not be perceived. But it is perceived that when the pot is destroyed, its parts are seen. And in those parts also, it is ascertained that there is production in the order of binary compounds and so on.

No, because the plural and dual forms are based on the number of components. For example, in substances in a substance, there is ellipsis of one. But the plural form is used in relation to the effect-substances. Many effect-substances produce the substance. And the eternal substances have the number two, not that they are eternal. Because they exist even in the effect-substance.🔽And one cannot produce successively or simultaneously, because it has a single nature. For example, a single atom does not produce an effect successively, because what is capable cannot be delayed. And if it produces simultaneously and does not produce again later, there is no reason.

The substance is the effect of these. Thus, there is no contradiction in the rule that conjunction alone is the cause of the effect-substance, and there is no restriction on the number of atoms in the cause.🔽Thus, atoms endowed with the number two produce the effect-substance. Because they produce it when there is the presence of valid means of knowledge that refute the theories of one or many. But duality produces the dyad, like a pair of threads.

Now, if largeness in the triadic atom is due to atomic dimension itself, then the transformation of the effect is due to the dimension of the cause, as it is observed to be superior.

Therefore, because of the undesirable consequence of the cessation of the usage of atom if there is no atom, the dimension of the atom is not the cause.

He says: In the production of substances, it is independent. Even though it depends on the inherent and other causes, it is independent because it does not depend on subsequent causes. And this is as it is explained, not otherwise. If it is asked how this is known, it is from the statement from those that depend and those that do not depend. And the meaning of this aphorism is as follows: Before the production of the final conjunction of the threads, the threads, which depend on that, do not produce the cloth. But those of the same class are taken up for the production of another cloth, because their capacity is determined. And when that is produced, they are independent and immediately produce it. Thus, in the production of substances, conjunction is independent. For this very reason, there is no other capacity except the final conjunction. And it is said in the section on earth that this is because it is in the form of the final auxiliary.

The two examples are stated with the intention of expressing a specific difference. For thus: The conjunction of the hawk and the post is produced by action and by conjunction. But the conjunction of the extended [objects] with the atoms is produced by action alone.

The action of the other part also, like the conjunction with the other part, is with the whole. Thus there are three conjunctions.

In this very place, the reading of the process that produces twofoldness was in the mother text, because of the cognition of conjunction. And the disjunction of the qualified part and the whole is the non-inherent cause. The rest is the instrumental cause.

For when a thread conjoined with grass is connected with another thread, a two-threaded [cloth] is produced. And at the same time as the production of its form and so on, a conjunction with grass is produced. So in its production, an inherent cause must be sought. And here, action is not possible, because both [thread and grass] are inactive, and because the capacity of form and so on is determined only in the production of its own effect. And because the production of an existent effect is not observed without an inherent cause, the conjunction of thread and grass itself is the inherent cause, being of the same kind and being proximate. But proximity is of two kinds: inherence in the same object as the effect and inherence in the same object as the cause.

And the conjunction between the effect and the non-effect is preceded by the conjunction of the cause and the non-cause. The conjunction born of conjunction arises when the threads are connected with another thread, producing the two-threaded cloth. Then, when connected with another thread, another effect arises. Thus, with the obstruction of many effects, how can the threads be the cause of the cloth's production? No. If the commenced effect itself becomes the cause of production when it obtains another cooperating factor, then there would be the doctrine of the cause being commenced. And in that case, the material things would have the same or different locations. Thus, what is commenced by the two threads exists in the threads.

When there is a conjunction of earth and water atoms, simultaneously with that, there are two other conjunctions - one of the earth atom with another earth atom, and one of the water atom with another water atom.

Now, how is there mutual connection between the two dyads that are connected with each other as cause and effect?

What is the evidence? He says: The principle that an effect must necessarily be conjoined with a non-cause that is conjoined with a cause is the evidence. Thus, the earthy dyad is conjoined with the watery atom that is conjoined with its cause, because it is an effect whose cause is conjoined with that, like the dyad conjoined with the virana. Or the watery atom is conjoined with the effect whose cause is conjoined with itself, because it is conjoined with the cause of that, like the virana conjoined with the dyad.

But the absence of statement can also occur due to delusion, so it is not established otherwise. For the purpose of refuting this, he says: The conjunction of atoms with space and so on occurs in a part, produced by the action of one of them. If it is asked how conjunctions and disjunctions of atoms occur without abandoning space, it is like Devadatta's without abandoning the tree. For thus, when a person ascends from the root region to the upper region, conjunctions and disjunctions are observed without abandoning the tree. He is conjoined with the tree in the root region, in the middle region, and in the tip region. And those conjunctions are not of the part itself. The notion he is conjoined with the tree is observed.

Since the action is not seen to have the power to destroy the quality, and there is no other cause of destruction, separation must be accepted. And the notion of separation is figurative in the absence of conjunction.

For disjunction does not occur in the absence of contact like action, but it does occur when that exists.

Because the difference in the collection is intended. For thus one is characterized by the division of causes, but the other is characterized by the division of causes and non-causes. And due to the difference in those, the difference in the division is indeed established. Because the difference in the effect such as a pot is seen due to the difference in the collection.

It is said: When the action arises in the hand, etc. The action arising in the hand from its own cause, not producing the division of other parts that opposes the conjunction that produces the substance, begins the division from the space and other places. The word etc. includes the soul and so on. But when, after the destruction of the previous conjunction, it begins the conjunction with the other places such as space, at that time those divisions of cause and non-cause begin the divisions of effect and non-effect. The hand is the cause of the body and space etc. are the non-cause, their divisions. The body is the effect of the hand and space etc. are the non-effect, their divisions begin. In its production, the body, space etc. are the inherent cause and the divisions of the hand, space etc. are the non-inherent cause. The proximity is possible in both forms, so it is to be accepted because there is no contradiction. From the inherence of the effect and the same object,

Because the notion of direct perception is mistaken due to rapid occurrence, like the piercing of a hundred lotus petals. Just as the direct knowledge that a hundred lotus petals are pierced simultaneously is not a valid means of knowledge because it is contradicted by the inference of the perceiver, so too in that case, the knowledge of simultaneity that the division of the body is simultaneous with the division of the hand is not a valid means of knowledge because it is contradicted by inference. If it is asked what the inference is, it is the division of the parts of the body having a different substratum. Thus, the action of the desired parts does not produce the division that is only connected to a substratum different from its own substratum, because it is an action, like the action accepted by both parties. And it is not contradicted by direct perception like the inference that fire is not hot because it is produced. Because it has five aspects. Thus,

But for the distinction that precedes the distinction of the cause, there is an interval of two moments, occurring immediately after the destruction of conjunction and the destruction of the substance. But in the parts of the lotus leaf, when the action arises from the connection with the swift needle etc., from the division there is destruction of the conjunction, and then the destruction of the leaf. Again, from the connection with another leaf, the action of the parts arises. This sequence can be inferred even in a hundred leaves. Thus, even when there is an interval of many hundreds of moments, the acceptance of swift appearance as the cause of delusion is due to the delusion of simultaneity through swift appearance. But when there is an interval of one moment, it will certainly occur. Therefore, because the delusion of simultaneity through swift appearance is false, the distinctions between cause and non-cause give rise to the distinctions between effect and non-effect.

Or space etc. is separated by what is separated from itself, because it is the cause of what is separated from that cause, like grass which is separated from threads.

This is not correct. Why? Because of the lack of understanding of simultaneity. The opponent has not understood simultaneity, hence he says this. It is as follows: Simultaneity is the capability of conjunction and disjunction with each other. The parts have the capability of conjunction and disjunction with other things, but not with each other. Thus there is no deviation.

What is the use of the all-pervading property of inherence in the substratum of the two? This is not so. Because the existence of separate motion in non-eternal things is not invariably concomitant with inherence in the substratum of the two, inherence in the substratum of the two alone is the definition of conjunction. And because that exists, that alone is the definition of conjunction. He says: There is no separate motion of the skin sense organ and the body. But there is inherence in the conjoined things. Therefore, conjunction is established between them. Thus, because the skin sense organ and the body cannot be separated without death, even in the absence of separate motion, their conjunction is established. Therefore, inherence in the substratum of the two alone is the definition of conjunction. Because they inhere in their own substrata by mutually excluding each other's substratum. Similarly, even though a newly produced pot, etc. has no motion, the perception of its conjunction with space, etc. at the same time as the production of color, etc. establishes inherence in the substratum of one of them alone as the definition of conjunction.

For permanent things, after showing the concomitance of the property of having separate motion, the counter-concomitance is stated. Since the impermanent yarn and cloth do not have any other substratum than each other, there is no conjunction or disjunction between them. Although the yarns exist in the threads, still in the cloth substance there is no other substratum apart from the yarns, so there is an absence of the relation of inherence in a common substratum. Due to that absence, there is no conjunction or disjunction between them. And the property of having separate motion is qualified. Since both are possible in the case of the pot and atoms, there is restriction of both or restriction of one. Restriction of both alone, because in the restriction of one there is no specific reason. Thus, in the case of the permanent atom there is the property of having separate motion, but in the impermanent pot there is the relation of inherence in a common substratum. Since both are established by concomitance and counter-concomitance in both cases, it is proper to take them here by possibility. And where it is impermanent alone, there is the property of having separate motion, but in the permanent atom there is the relation of inherence in a common substratum.

No, because usage is what is to be proved. For thus, division should be used as perishable, because of momentariness. Or, momentariness is the quality of having rapid destruction as its cause. Therefore, in the proof of the destruction of division, there is no non-distinction from what is to be proved. Now, what is that cause of destruction? The subsequent conjunction. How? Because of the existence up to the subsequent conjunction. The subsequent conjunction itself is the limit, the boundary, of which there is existence. Thus, the existence up to the subsequent conjunction. After that, there is non-existence. This is understood from positive and negative concomitance. But its destruction is not like that of conjunction. For just as the destruction of conjunction is only of that conjunction which is of two things, not so the destruction of division.

But disjunction does not remain like conjunction. Why? Because it would follow that it is destroyed by those two themselves, just as the existing conjunction ceases due to disjunction of those two. In the same way, disjunction would also cease due to conjunction of those two. If it is accepted, that is not so. Because there is no continuation of the cognition of disjunction like the cognition of conjunction. For just as the cognition of conjunction continues with respect to disjunction from another object, there is no continuation of the cognition of disjunction with respect to conjunction with another object. And the cognition of non-contact should be seen as the absence of conjunction due to the presence of an overrider. Otherwise, when a lump moves to another place or dies, the cognition of disjunction would occur even when grasping one lump, due to its remaining. But this does not happen. Therefore, the primary cognition of disjunction is with respect to a substance with an existing action. Elsewhere, it is figurative due to similarity.

The body is not the effect of the finger. Therefore, although the separation of the space of the finger has proximity with the separation of the space of the body because it occurs in space, it is still not a cause. Therefore, it is reasonable to figuratively call the hand the body because it is the cause of the body's origin. This much is the example.

Just as when there is conjunction of threads and grass, a substance is not produced because of being of a different kind, similarly, a substance is not produced from the conjunction of two atoms and an atom. For, one atom is eternal, and the other, the dyad, is non-eternal, so there is difference of kind. And a conjunction of different kinds does not produce a substance. Therefore, even when there is conjunction of the dyad and the atom, a substance is not produced. The effect produced in the atom is action, because it does not produce the disjunction that is opposed to the conjunction that produces a substance, and it produces disjunction even with the space of the atom, like the action of grass. Thus, after ceasing the previous conjunction and making a subsequent conjunction, it is destroyed. The destruction is according to the method stated earlier.

For that purpose, the terms para and apara are used. Even then, the cause of the designation and cognition of the distant and near is not excluded for the self of space. Therefore, it should be understood as when there is the quality of being a qualifier. Similarly, generality is also the cause of the designation and cognition of the distant and near when there is the quality of being a qualifier. Therefore, the term substance is used. Thus, priority and posteriority are distinguished from other things, because when there is the quality of being a qualifier of substance, they are the cause of the designation and cognition of the distant and near. But that which is not distinguished from the other is not so. Like form etc. The usage or the conclusion is to be established.

It is like this.

And none of form etc. is the qualifier, because they are different from the usage of that [qualifier]. And a cognition that is not contradicted cannot exist without a cause.

Because momentariness is denied. But it is said by acceptance. If distinction is accepted as different, and if it generates the usage of the qualified, then it is merely a difference in name.

This is not so, because it is possible in relation to the succession of the body from birth onwards and the changes of the sun. For example, for one person there are more changes of the sun from birth onwards, for another fewer. So the notions of near and far arise in relation to that. For an old person there is the notion of farness because there are more changes of the sun, and for a young person there is the notion of nearness because there are fewer. Priority and posteriority arise in relation to that. This is indeed possible in relation to the succession of the body and the changes of the sun. And the difference between these two and the priority and posteriority based on direction is accepted to be based on time, if no other cause is possible. For there cannot be a mixture of these two from the same cause.

And thus the aphorism: Paratva and aparatva are with respect to one direction and time, which are near and far. (1.1.10) Those that have one direction and one time are said to be so. By those two, the inhering cause is indicated. By one direction, the restriction is only with respect to paratva and aparatva produced by direction. By one time, by the present time, in both cases. For paratva and aparatva are not produced by the non-existent and the existent and non-existent. By the near and the far, the near and far cognitions are said to be the instrumental cause, with the inhering cause as subordinate. Thus, indeed, it is so. Paratva and aparatva are with respect to the cognitions. The word 'va' here in the aphorism indicates the alternative. The word 'va' in 'paramaparam ca vai' in the aphorism is used in the sense of cause. Because of the priority of the cause and the posteriority of the cause, paratva and aparatva are shown to be the non-inhering cause.

And this is not so. If it is argued that non-apprehension is due to non-manifestation, that is not so. Because there is no evidence of their existence. And if the existence of the cognition of proximity and distance etc. is accepted, then the apprehension of what is produced now alone is indeed possible. Therefore, the conjunction of direction with the whole and the conjunction of time with the whole are figuratively called priority and posteriority because they bring about priority and posteriority. And it should not be said that the description of origination etc. is unconnected because priority and posteriority are mutually dependent. Because mutual dependence is not observed everywhere. Thus, the seed and sprout are not mutually dependent. When the seed is destroyed, the series beginning with the dyad etc. occurs after some time.

Similarly, this Purusha, whose own nature is unchanged, makes the insentient mind appear as if it were sentient due to proximity. But in reality, it does not have sentience, because it is subject to change. Knowledge, however, is a transformation of the intellect in the form of the sense organs that have taken on the appearance of the object. Then, considering that the Purusha is eager for enjoyment, the intellect becomes intention. And from the awareness of that intention, due to the cessation of the previous form of the sense organs, there is a transformation into the appearance of the object. Otherwise, if the previous form were not abandoned, the object would not be cognized later just as it was before. And the transformation into the appearance of the object should be understood as belonging to this blue, to this yellow, etc., due to the restriction to each object. Otherwise, if there were no transformation into the appearance of the object, this restriction would not exist due to the non-distinction of the transformation. Thus, when the sense organs have transformed into the appearance of the object, the intellect also transforms into that appearance.

But the relation of the object of enjoyment and the enjoyer is to be considered because enjoyment is unreal. And karma is not the regulator, because it is accomplished by the intellect. Thus, karma accomplished by the intellect would be enjoyed by all souls, due to the absence of a specific relation with the soul. And the intellect is not the agent, because it is insentient. For consciousness is the primordial matter. It does not engage in action or instrumentality. For agency is independence, and in that case instrumentality would not be dependence. Because independence and dependence are of the nature of injunction and prohibition. Thus, the agency of the soul alone should be accepted. And for it, which does not act before, there is no transformation in acting, because the effect is produced when all the factors are complete, and it is not produced when they are incomplete.

But as for the soul, apart from its nature as pure consciousness, there is no other eagerness for enjoyment.

That which has an infinite object is called 'ananta'. The state of that is 'ananta-atva'. But the object is that which is desired by this, so it is the collection of causal factors, not just one causal factor.

And it cannot be said that even without the apprehension of the previous consciousness, the object itself is grasped, because they have the characteristic of being graspable when they are near. He says this:🔽Without grasping the proximate producing cognition that has the characteristic of being graspable,

Just as in one's own continuum, consciousness produced as unknown illuminates objects, so it would be in other continua as well, because there is no difference. If consciousness in one's own continuum, which is known to oneself, illuminates objects, then in that case, an object that is different from the body of consciousness is not illuminated at all. For, if these objects have the nature of illumination, how do they differ from consciousness? Because consciousness itself has that nature. And if they have the nature of non-illumination, they would never be illuminated. Therefore, they are said to be consciousness itself, because they have the nature of illumination. For existence is pervaded by the nature of illumination. And that, as it ceases, takes with it existence, which is pervaded by it, and ceases in relation to external objects. Therefore, those that differ from consciousness are non-existent.

So how can there be the relation of the apprehended and apprehender between them? Because that is not possible between an existent and a non-existent. And if it is accepted that the two arise at the same time, then what is the apprehended and what is the apprehender? Because there is no distinction. And because it is impossible to establish dependence on the object for consciousness and the object, which are confined to their own nature, there is no relation of the apprehended and apprehender. Similarly, through the negation of the composite, it is merely a collection of form and so on. And that, being collected, is not different from the collected. So when it is established, the object itself does not exist. Because the collection does not appear as ultimately real. But the atoms, which are ultimately real, are not the objects of our perception, because they are beyond the senses. And the effect, being unreal, is not a mark of appearance. Therefore, the distinction between the apprehended and apprehender is only a part of consciousness, due to beginningless predispositions. This is stated.

Just as for one with an eye disease, consciousness arises with that form even in the absence of an object, so also for one without beginningless impressions, consciousness arises with that form even in the absence of action etc. But the knowledge of hair etc. by one with an eye disease is objectless because it is contradicted.

And the production or destruction of consciousness is not due to annulment, because in that case everything would be like that.

Because without a difference in objects, the absence of a difference in cognitions would follow. Cognitions such as the cognition of form, the cognition of taste, etc. appear with mutually exclusive forms. Therefore, a difference must be accepted. Or, the difference in cognitions is due to the difference in impressions. Even if that also produces a qualified cognition, if it is different from cognition, it is merely a difference in names. If it is not different, both are of the form of cognition, and there is no difference anywhere. Thus, there would be no diversity such as the cognition of form, the cognition of taste, etc. And the difference in cognitions is not due to the difference in forms, because that also is impossible. Thus, if mere cognition is the real form, then the cognition of blue, etc. is valid because it has a real form, and the cognition of two moons, etc. is invalid because it has an unreal form.

These two are different, like white and yellow, because of the difference in their nature. For if they were non-different, then cognition would also be apprehended by the blue, and the blue would be the apprehender of the cognition. But this is not the case. And because of the difference in causes, cognition is different from blue. For thus: the form of cognition is from cognition itself, the restriction to objects is from the sense organ, and the grasping of the form is from the object. Thus, because of this difference, they are different. If there is no difference in causes, then what is it? Merely the difference in exclusion. Cognition is the exclusion of non-cognition. Having a form is the exclusion of formlessness. The restriction to objects is the exclusion of other forms. If so, then since the eye and the cognition of blue cannot operate on the excluded forms of the restriction to objects, having a form, and cognition, they are not causes at all. Because the excluded form is not a real entity. If the exclusion from non-cognition is not different from the cognition that is excluded, then the cognition is one.

And the presence of a form cannot be established by the fact that there is a distinction of objects, because it exists even otherwise. For example, even though there is no difference in the fact that blue is produced by all the causes, it is designated by that [blue] itself because it operates in the form of an object, not because it impresses its form [on cognition]. Even though there is no difference in the fact that all [causes] produce [cognition], a reason for the distinction that only the object impresses its form [on cognition] must be stated. If, on the other hand, the object impresses its form [on cognition] because it operates in the form of an object, then let there be just the form of an object as the reason for the restriction of designation. What is the use of an impossible imaginary form? For example, if blue and so on impress their uncommon forms [on cognition], there would be no cognition in the form of consciousness. But if they impress their common forms [on cognition], there would be no distinction of objects.

That is not so. In the absence of an established self, how can the form be superimposed on the nature of consciousness? First, that which is not yet arisen or has already ceased cannot be the superimposer. Nor is it simultaneous with arising, because at the time of self-attainment, superimposition is not possible. Therefore, since there is no evidence for the existence of form, it is reasonable to conclude that this distinction is due to the distinction in the object itself.

For thus, only that object with regard to which knowledge arises is perceived, not any other. Thus, the relation between object and subject is the determiner. Therefore, knowledge is the manifestation of the object, not the illuminator. The alternatives beginning with Is the illuminator of the grasped object or the ungrasped object? are relevant only to the opponent's view, because the eye and other instruments of action are accepted as illuminators of the object. And where knowledge or a specific mark is present, the operation of the grasped object in the determination is accepted itself.

Thus, the operation of the mind and speech grasps the antecedence of the cognition in the form of appearance, because it terminates in the self itself. And that mind which is the cause of this also does not grasp its causal nature, nor do both. It cannot be said that the conceptual cognition grasping the relation of cause and effect arises through the succession of impressions, because the impression is in accordance with the experience. How can there be a conceptual cognition determining that when the relation of cause and effect is not grasped? And a conceptual cognition superimposing a form that is not real. If that [conceptual cognition] is not the object of the [relation of] cause and effect even indirectly, then inference does not operate at all in the non-grasping of the relation of cause and effect.

For thus: When there is the knowledge of a mirage, by the cessation of the impression produced by the knowledge of water, even at a later time, there is no arising of the memory water was seen by me, and thus there is no activity directed towards that place. And if contradiction is not accepted, the distinction of true and false knowledge being impossible, there would be no establishment of victory and defeat for the proponent and opponent, as stated.

For example, clay, water etc. appear differently to those whose eyes are affected, not in their own form. It is indeed accepted that this is false knowledge, because it is contradicted. And the contradiction is accepted to be just that, the perception of those whose eyes are not affected. And it is far away that even a small thing is perceived as great in the desert, and in close proximity it is perceived as small only. This contradicts it. And it is not contradicted by that itself, because the knower alone appears in all places without that form. And greatness appears only in a particular place, not elsewhere, so it is non-existent. For that alone is the nature of things which is non-contradictory and which accomplishes the desired result for those with healthy minds. Therefore, clay, water etc. appear in that form to those whose eyes are not affected, and accomplish the desired result.

The two that have many well-known distinctions are said to be such. This is the determination of the object, not the compound meaning the two that are well-known and have many distinctions. And because doubt has a property-possessor as its object, how can both be possible objects when only one property-possessor exists there? There is no fault in stating the position. It is like this. It is restricted that doubt occurs only where many distinctions are well-known. But the two are not objects at the same time. Because one cannot exist there.

It should be explained that the perception of the possessor of similarity is said to be the perception of the mere similarity in this, but not the perception of mere similarity. Because the doubt regarding the possessor is due to the perception of the property, not because of the non-perception of the property, since the doubt is with a different substratum. Here, by mentioning mere in from the mere perception of similarity, it shows the non-apprehension of the extreme particular. Even when the universal is apprehended along with the particular, there is no doubt. Thus, both are mentioned, because the non-apprehension of the particular without the apprehension of the universal does not generate doubt. Even so, when both are present in a tree etc. that is not mounted on the first, there is no doubt. Therefore, the word from the recollection of both particulars is used. And the recollection of the particulars is seen to generate doubt only when the above-mentioned [conditions] are not present. Thus, the combined [conditions] are the cause.

By what form? Internally and externally. But since doubt is of five kinds, its twofold nature is illogical. No, it is logical by its own subdivisions. Thus, external doubt is threefold: from the cognition of common properties, from the cognition of multiple properties, and from contradiction. Internal doubt is twofold, to be determined by the mind from perception and non-perception. And this is intended by the author of the commentary, since he says: The common and multiple properties are based on the object of knowledge. Perception and non-perception, on the other hand, are based on the knower. So there is no contradiction. And if you do not accept the inclusion, then the fivefold nature of doubt would be illogical, even by the distinction of the object of perception and non-perception. If, on the other hand, it is not mentioned because it is included by this alone, then the fivefold nature is not mentioned just because it is included by the twofold nature, since that is its subdivision.

Now, since knowledge does not exist at the time of seeing the general and remembering the specific, how can it be the object of doubt? Thus, in that knowledge, the common property of being about future rain is the same. Knowledge arises in that specific knowledge. But it is in the process of destruction. The specific memory of correctness and incorrectness is in the process of arising. Therefore, when the specific memory is present, how can the past knowledge be the object?

And the character of being a means of valid knowledge is the same in both cases. This is true. Nevertheless, there is a difference in that doubt is accepted with regard to the subject qualified by the property to be proved, because of the apprehension of an inferential mark qualified by the general and specific, while in the other case, in perception of a subject that is not an inferential mark and is devoid of the property to be proved but possesses the general, the general characteristic is not denied. And the presence of the general characteristic is perceived through positive and negative concomitance, and also through recognition.

That is not correct, because it cannot be the object here, as it does not exist here. Therefore, the object is only the mother-of-pearl, etc., which is the object of the operation of the sense organ and is indicated by the finger, etc. Otherwise, how could the cognition of silver produced with reference to another object be contradicted by the cognition of mother-of-pearl? Because when the objects are different, there cannot be the relation of the contradictory and the contra-dictory. Therefore, the cognition of silver produced with reference to mother-of-pearl is contradicted by the cognition of mother-of-pearl, which is its auxiliary with reference to its own object, and is made known as qualified by falsity, due to the approach of another object. But the cognition of silver has silver as its object, which is well-known to all people. Due to its being produced with reference to mother-of-pearl by abandoning that, it is fallacious. By this, the view that this is a conceptual cognition without an object is refuted. The object, such as mother-of-pearl, etc., is established by a means of valid knowledge.

That sky in which the coverings of clouds have departed is said to be so. Similarly, it is unmoving, immovable, and its form is similar, equal, to that. And that sky having a body similar to the ocean, due to the sky being supersensible, even though it is of the described form, the apprehension of similarity with the ocean is not possible. Thus, the pride of perception is objectless. Similarly, the darkness of night arises in the night. What is it distinguished by? It is dark like a heap of collyrium powder.

Because potency is different from the effect in the form of the final cooperating factor. And the cause and effect are not one, because they are the objects of different appearances. And the difference in appearance is the reason for the usage of difference among things. Even in the existence of that, if oneness is accepted, there would be the consequence of all being one, and it would not be the twenty-four principles.

There, the determination is only in relation to existence, substance, earth, tree, form, branches etc. Thus, the knowledge of ascertainment is 'it exists'.

Doubt, on the other hand, arises from the perception of a common characteristic regarding the object of perception and inference, and has both well-known and unknown aspects. Thus, even indecision is said to have a distinct cause. But the causes of the arising of dream knowledge are different from those. Thus, it is different due to the difference in causes. Even if there is a difference in definition, if non-difference is accepted, then that would be the case everywhere. Similarly, dream knowledge arises even regarding a completely unknown object, and not so in the case of error etc. Therefore, even if the presence of characteristics like grasping both is possible, dream knowledge is to be accepted as different from doubt etc. because the definition of dream is applicable.

One understands it as form after the utterance of the word form, so knowledge is produced by both [sense organ and word].

And since the knowledge of sound cannot last for that long, how can there be knowledge arising from both? In this case, an action arises in the mind connected with the ear, which produces separation. And at the very moment when the conjunction is destroyed, the knowledge of sound is produced. Then, the production of the knowledge of sound, the destruction of the conjunction, the production of the subsequent conjunction, then the production of the conjunction with the eye connected with the object, the production of the knowledge of form.

Even when the mind is related to the eye at a later time, since the form and sound are already apprehended, the knowledge arising from both does indeed occur. And the postulation of a cause is done by the existence of the effect. And this is perceived here. In this way, the origination is contemplated. Similarly, because of the designation by the word, even when seeing with the eye, one says I did not know the form, but understood it from the word form, so the knowledge is arising from both. If it is not directly perceived due to the operation of the word, then the result of the other means of knowledge would be from the operation of the sense organ. This is not so. In the definition of perception, the qualification indeterminate is used, but in the definition of verbal knowledge, the qualification not produced by the sense organ is not mentioned. Therefore, there is no restriction on the cooperation of the word. Verbal knowledge may arise from the sense organ cooperating with the word, or from that which lacks it.

If it be said that the soul, the sense, the mind and the object, their contact, would also be the result of perception, because inference, etc. also arise from that, we say no. Because when mere knowledge arises, the internal organ cannot be a sense. It has been said that the definition of a sense is that which produces non-deceptive, inexpressible, determinate knowledge. And an inference is not a knowledge of an object apprehended by a sense. Thus, the result-qualification theory is that perception is that knowledge which arises in regard to an object, depending on a sense, which is non-erroneous, inexpressible, and determinate. But these qualifications such as non-deviation, etc. are also present in the knowledge of a qualified past object, because they are superimposed on the cognition.

And the totality occurs only when the final auxiliary is reached, not before, so it arises only then. Thus, it is known by this, so the collection itself, indicated by the sense organ etc., is infallible, determinate, and nondiscriminative. By the word nondiscriminative, the collection is discriminated by the fact of generating knowledge. So even in the view that the collection is qualified, there is a connection with the qualifications. True, but infallibility, etc. are qualities of the result.

For, it is said to be pramāṇa because it is by this that one is made to know (pramīyate). By that which is different from the agent and the object, knowledge (prama) is produced. But if it were a qualifier of the form, then pramāṇa would not have the nature of being produced and a producer, but would have the nature of being non-deviating and possessing other properties. And that is too wide and not wide enough. And thus, such a form exists even in the knowledge that is a reflection and so on.

Therefore, in their view, only the nature of a qualifier is appropriate. Thus, for the Sautrantikas, the form is the means of knowledge, the object is the object of knowledge, and self-awareness is considered the result. Thus, knowledge itself is the means and result of knowledge, or it is an assumption. But this is not correct. Because the means and the result are not observed to be non-different. And it has been said that the form of the object is not possible in consciousness. Then how can it be a means of valid knowledge? And it is not proper for a means of valid knowledge to be determined by the object in the form of the object, because the object is absolutely imperceptible, and the connection with it is not observed. And if an operation without a grasped connection were to indicate a particular object, there would be an overextension. And in that case, the form of color would also be a determiner of taste, etc., like color, because there would be no difference in the non-observation of a connection in both cases. And for those who maintain the awareness of form alone, there is no grasping of another particular object, because the form of the object is not grasped.

There, for the yogis in the state of concentration, the direct perception of the imperceptible nature is produced by the mind aided by the dharmas born of yoga, which is its contributory cause. In which objects? The self, other selves, space, direction, time, air, atoms, and mind are called thus. The perception of the yogis is not only by the mind connected with their own self etc., but also by the connected inherence in the qualities, actions, universals etc. that inhere in them. And the inherence is grasped by the relation of qualifier and qualified with the connected particulars. For this very reason, inherence is separately mentioned, because it is to be determined by a different conjunction. In the universals that reside in the atoms etc. and in the qualities and actions, it is by the inherence of the connected inherence.

In what objects? In subtle, obstructed, and distant objects. Subtle means atoms, obstructed means the abodes of the nāgas and so on, distant means the Meru mountains and so on. Perception of those is unobstructed. It arises by the power of the grace of the yoga-born qualities of those who are not in the state of samādhi. For the sense faculties of the yogi, by the grace of the special qualities, there is no obstruction anywhere. The mention of the contact of the four is for the purpose of illustration. Because it is grasped even by the contact of the three. Thus, the yogi, by the principle of the continuum being unobstructed by the grace of the yoga-born qualities, hears what comes to the ear region, spoken by Brahmā and so on, by the contact of the three.

He says: In the origination of the knowledge of the universal and particular, the mere perception, which is not differentiated and devoid of the knowledge of the qualifier, is the means of valid knowledge called perception. The object of valid knowledge is the universal and particular. Now, why is another cognition not accepted even in that mere perception of the form? He says: In that mere perception of the form, there is no other means of valid knowledge, no other cognition. Because it is not of the nature of a result, because it is purposeless. For example, the knowledge of the qualified is tinged with the qualifier, and manifesting in a way that cannot be otherwise, it shows the existence of the knowledge of the qualifier. But in the knowledge of the qualifier, there is no tinge of the qualifier. And if another cognition is accepted, there would be an infinite regress. Therefore, there is only the non-origination of the knowledge of the qualified. And the knowledge of the qualified is seen to be the cause of the knowledge of the qualifier.

That is incorrect. Because the rule is that the restriction is to be made from where the word eva is used, it would be the inferable object that is restricted, not the inferential mark. For the inferential mark is not abandoned by the inferable object, so the relation in the subject is known through pervasion. But because the inferential mark is not restricted, its occurrence elsewhere is known, so the word prasiddham eva in tadanvita is made to have the meaning of restriction. Even there, if the restriction prasiddham eva tadanvite is accepted, then there would be the undesirable consequence that what occurs in only a part of the similar instance would not be an indicator. If it is restricted to prasiddham eva tadanvite in order to exclude occurrence in the dissimilar instance, then since exclusion from the dissimilar instance is established by the non-restriction itself, the word ca na asti in tadabhāve is useless.

The word atha is used in place of ca. The inferential mark is that which has the exclusion of non-existence in the dissimilar instance. The dissimilar instance is that which is different from it, or that which is contradictory to it, or the absence of it. All three types are included by the phrase asati. Because the form of being the absence of the probandum is the same everywhere. There, if it is restricted to the presence only in the subject, then there would be the consequence of the uncommon being the indicator. And from this, there would be no exclusion of the fallacy of incompleteness. And there would be the uselessness of the other word. If it is a negation of impossibility, saying only in the subject, then even so, because the presence is not determined, the occurrence of the inferential mark elsewhere is obtained. Therefore, the phrase present in what is similar to that is useless. If it is done for the purpose of restriction, then even there, if it is restricted to the presence only in what is similar to that, there is contradiction between the previous and subsequent statements. If it is said that the occurrence in the subject is established, and then the exclusion of the dissimilar instance and so on is done, then there is the fallacy of incompleteness.

And so, fire is not hot, because it is an aggregate, like a jar, although the three characteristics are present, it is contradicted by the perception of heat. The too wide fallacy is as follows: Sound is eternal, because it is not perceived to have non-eternal properties, like ākāśa. Sound is non-eternal, because it is not perceived to have eternal properties, like a jar. Even here, although the three characteristics are present, it is not a probans, because it has a counter-probans. And so, for the exclusion of these two, the condition of having an uncontradicted content and the absence of a counter-probans should be understood to be implied by the word and in the definition, since it has the sense of including what is not stated.

And thus, they say, since the distinction between eternal and non-eternal is not perceived, it is included in the unestablished when it is intended by the proponent or opponent. But that is wrong. Even when the fault of the thesis exists, it is said to be beyond temporal limitation because it is stated after the faulty position of the reason has been presented. Now, if it is said that the three characteristics are not contradicted by perception because contradiction and invariable concomitance are incompatible, or that if they are accepted, there is no three-fold characteristic, that is not so. Even when the reason of being produced has the three characteristics in proving that the part of fire is not hot, the invariable concomitance is not established because of the subject's presentation of the opposite meaning. And perception establishes the body of all living beings as the producer of practical efficiency, fire, not in another form. Thus, perception is the cooperative condition of its own object. And inference is not like that. Therefore, it is contradicted.

No, because the refutation is known by perception itself. Thus, when perception presents a contrary meaning, it shows that this inference has a contradicted object. If it is argued that when the effect's non-hotness is to be proved, since there is no evidence for the hot and non-hotness of fiery atoms, the reason of being produced is inconclusive due to doubtful difference, and is not fallacious due to being contradicted by a later proof, that is not so. Because for one who accepts hotness in atoms and proves non-hotness in their effect, the ascertainment of difference is possible. And even for one with doubtful difference, after stating the side of heat, the contradiction by being contradicted by a later proof is not reasonable. And there is no rule that where there is one fault, there are not others. As in the case of a reason with many unestablished qualifiers, etc.

For instance, when there is a doubt as to the presence of the ‘Universal’ and the rest, the disputants, on the ground of the non-apprehension of the specific peculiarity, have their doubt aroused; one of them, being in doubt, and suspecting the other of having a motive behind him, puts forward the Reason in question, for the purpose of ascertaining the real state of things; the other also is in doubt; so that neither of them is in a position to urge the falsity of the Reason; if, on the other hand, either of them were to assert the presence of the particular ‘Universal’ and the rest, by means of a valid means of cognition, then the Reason would be ‘unproven’, and not ‘inconclusive’; and when there is doubt, there can be no ‘contradictory’ or ‘inconclusive’ reason; hence the Reason is not ‘inconclusive’. Nor is it ‘contradictory’; as we shall explain later on.

However, they do have the nature of probans and probandum.

When the particularity of being expressible is the probandum, there is no counter-example, as there is no possible object that is not expressible. For by means of a valid means of knowledge one perceives the counter-example, and then establishes its exclusion from that by verbal statement.

Whatever is without a self is devoid of life and so on, like a pot and so on. And the living body is not like that. Therefore, it is not without a self. Since the non-existence of a self is accepted in all cases, there is no similar instance in the case of the living body when the negation of non-self is to be established. And the possession of life and so on is entirely excluded from the dissimilar instance. Therefore, it is only by the invariable concomitance of the negative concomitance that it is an indicator. And it is not so in the case of the uncommon [reason], because it is not an indicator due to the invariable concomitance of the exclusion from the similar instance and so on. Now, if the possession of a self is intended here by the negation of non-self, and the self is not well-known, then the subject is one whose qualifier is not well-known.

When the reason occurs in the imagined similar instance, it has concomitance and non-concomitance. But in the excluded instance, it is a fallacy to say it is not common, because the establishment of the subject and so on is real. But if it were imagined, how could there be an establishment of the reason and its fallacies? Because imagination is not distinguished anywhere. Now, in the case of a pot, is the exclusion of having a soul the exclusion of having breath and so on, or is it due to the nature of the thing itself? Thus the non-concomitance is doubtful. And there is no evidence as to whether having a soul exists or does not exist in a pot. This is not so. Because the exclusion of having a soul, which is the cause of a particular effect, is established by the absence of that particular effect, such as breath and so on. Thus, in a body that has breath and so on, the special connection with the soul that is capable of producing breath and so on proves having a soul.

Otherwise, there would be the doubt that smoke might exist even without fire in another place or at another time.

For example, in the case of cowherds' huts and such, smoke arises from a moment of smoke even when the fire has long ceased. How then is there inference of fire from the perception of smoke, which is not its effect? If it is argued that inference is from the perception of what is produced by fire, that is not so. Because without the cognition of fire, the ascertainment of being produced by it in smoke is impossible. Or if there is cognition, what is the use of inference? And just as there is cognition of the nature of smoke, so too for one who has not cognized fire, the ascertainment of being produced by fire in smoke is seen for one dwelling in the coconut islands. And also because of the impossibility of the argument. For example, in proving the existence of fire in a mountain, being an effect is inconclusive. Or if the existence of fire in smoke is to be proved, there too being an effect is inconclusive. The reason is being an effect while having the nature of smoke. If so, having the nature of smoke alone is sufficient. So the fault of the reason is the uselessness of the qualification.

And if that were so, there would be the undesirable consequence of the impossibility of the relation of probandum and probans. It is like this. When the substratum is perceived, if both [tree-ness and shimshapa-ness] are perceived due to their identity, how can there be the relation of probandum and probans? But if there is non-perception even when that [substratum] is perceived, then there would not be identity. Or, if the relation of probandum and probans is due to the exclusion of superimposition because inference has both a universal and particular [aspect], then the relation of what is to be known and what is to be known is impossible in the case of identity and origination from that [particular]. Even if identity is accepted, there is no relation of probandum and probans because of the consequence of oneness. Similarly, even though there is no difference in identity between the two, just as tree-ness is cognized by shimshapa-ness, the cognition of shimshapa-ness by tree-ness would also occur.

If the inference of touch from form is due to dependence on the same causal complex, that is wrong, because the relation of what is to be inferred and what is the means of inference is observed to occur in the same moment. Thus, touch occurring at the same time as the moment of form is inferred, not the prior one. And in that case, dependence on the same causal complex is impossible. And there is no evidence that form and touch are causes in relation to each other's origination. The concomitance of one with the other is not observed in the other.

Because they are inseparable. Thus, an effect is cognized as preceded by a cause, and when it is cognized, it is an indicator. Just as from the perception of a particular flood in the river, it is inferred that it rained upstream. And so, with a flood carrying much foam, foam-like leaves, logs, and so on. When a particular flood in the river is previously perceived as the effect of rain, and upon its subsequent perception, it is proper to infer that this flood in the river is the effect of rain, because it is a particular flood in the river, like the flood in the river perceived before. A flood is the conjunction of water extending to both banks. That is indirectly the effect of rain, so the cause is also [an inferential mark]. Because it is previously perceived as producing the effect, when it is perceived, it is the inferential mark.

And an effect is seen to arise from an uncertain cause, just as a scorpion is born from a scorpion, from cow dung, and from a snake. In the same way, another uncertain cause should be inferred elsewhere. How then is the specific cause known from the effect, and the specific effect from the cause?

By what form? The seen and the seen in general. Among them, the seen is inference when there is no difference in the universal of the well-known and the probandum. The well-known and the probandum are the well-known and the probandum. When there is no difference in the universal of those two, the example and the subject, that inference is seen. For just as the property to be proved is fit to be perceived in the property-possessor of the example, so also in the subject. Thus, there is no difference in the property to be proved, but in the universal, the general. For example, having recognized the effect such as a painting etc. produced by a Brahmin, one again observes it produced by a Kshatriya etc. This is produced by some agent, because it is an effect such as a painting etc., like a previously observed effect such as a painting etc. of this kind. This inference is seen even when there is a difference in the universal, the general. Because the perception of the property to be proved is before and after the inference.

Thus, the example-subject is figuratively called 'to be established' because it is the locus of the property to be established, which is the same as the property of the conclusion. And the subject of the conclusion will become well-known after the inference, so it is well-known even before. The rest is as before.

And in that case, the property to be proved is indeed always unknown, prior to and after the inference. Now, if there is difference in the property to be proved, since invariable concomitance itself is unknown, how can there be inference? He says: Because of the universal concomitance of the inferential mark with the general property to be inferred. The inferential mark and the property to be inferred, their universal concomitance is that wherever this general means is, there this general end is. When that is grasped, inference proceeds, just as when the activity of farmers, traders, and royal servants is observed to have a desired result, the presence of a result is inferred in the case of the varnas and ashramas as well. What kind of activity? That which is seen to be undertaken without reference to a purpose such as obtaining alms, etc., the inference of a desired result.

But if the invalidity of inference is accepted, then in general there is the fault of proving what is already established, and in particular there is the absence of concomitance. And when the whole is to be proved, the reason does not have the property of the subject. And there is no positive concomitance, because the whole does not occur elsewhere. But if it is assumed that what occurs in even a part of the whole occurs in the whole, then because the means of knowledge is secondary, the ascertainment of the meaning of inference is difficult to obtain. For example, perception is the primary means of knowledge, while inference is secondary. Or it is figurative, because it requires the property of the subject in a figurative sense. What is secondary is not a means of knowledge. Even if the property to be proved exists, if the whole does not have the property of the subject elsewhere, then the whole is not the subject. But if the subject qualified by the property being conveyed is to be proved, then there is indeed the absence of positive concomitance. Thus all inference is not a means of knowledge.

When the subject qualified by the property to be proved is what is to be established, the property of the subject is logically possible. But the positive concomitance is by a property common to the probandum. For the presence of the reason in one place, and the absence of the probandum in the absence of that, is exclusion. And because the understanding of the probandum in the subject of the inference is seen to be from the perception of the inferential mark, the imagination of such positive concomitance is made. Or, if it is not accepted, there would not even be the knowledge of the fallacious concomitance. But that is seen, so there is a distinction. But by the contradictory, there would be the acceptance of another particular in the negation of a particular determined by it. But in the negation of all particulars, even the generally established particular determined by that is not established. Or, the general probandum which is necessarily pervaded by the general means of knowledge is necessarily established. Therefore, because the general probandum itself, which is implied by the particulars, is established by inference, the unseen result of the varnas and ashramas is established as only transcending the particulars.

Because the oneness of characteristics is different from that usage. Those that have the same rule, which is the means, as the characteristics are said to be like that. The state of those is the truth. Therefore, he says: Just as inference occurs regarding a supersensible object through the well-known connection and the recollection of the seen indicative mark, so it is also from words and so on. For just as, after seeing the indicative mark, for one who has grasped the connection, the recollection of the relation of invariable concomitance occurs, and that inference occurs regarding a supersensible object to be determined by those two, by the knowledge of the indicative mark and the recollection of the connection, so it is also from words and so on. Inference is that by which one infers. The knowledge of reflection is metaphorically or etymologically called inference. That is intended. Thus, so it is also from words and so on is the explanation of the example.

Because it is impossible to establish that the word 'cow' denotes an object with a dewlap etc. For thus: In proving that a word denotes an object by the relation of denoter and denoted, because of the absence of any other relation with the object, the fact of being a word 'cow' is not a reason. Because the fact of being a denoter is to be known by understanding, and because a natural relation is not possible. For smoke, by a natural relation, is a denoter of the object to be inferred, for all living beings. And a word is not so. Because the fact of being a denoter depends on a convention accomplished by the will of a person. For if there were a natural relation, then even without a convention, on hearing the words of barbarians etc., there would be the understanding of the meaning. But if the fact of being a denoter depends on a convention, then let that alone be. Enough of a permanent relation. And even in the absence of a permanent relation, there is no overextension. Because of the words that depend on a cause, the convention is only when the cause such as the quality of being a substance etc. is present. But for the words that are accidental, the convention is only when the cause such as the desire to speak etc.

Thus, from a sentence, one understands the convention as this is its denotator or this is its denotatum. From the usage of elders, like Devadatta, bring the white cow with the stick, one who is not learned understands the convention in words like Devadatta through positive and negative concomitance. Even for elders who have understood the convention from others, the usage is the answer to the question of beginninglessness. Or, the first person, the direct seer, is the maker of conventions for some. But a sentence-form word does not depend on convention even for conveying meaning.

And after the meaning is obtained by another means of knowledge, its grasping is accepted later.

The opponent understands that sound is impermanent because it is not perceived before and after its utterance by direct perception. And from inference, we will explain that in the examination of sound. And the inference of the impermanence of the Vedas: The Vedic statements are impermanent, because they are statements, like the statements accepted by both parties. Similarly, the composition of statements is preceded by intelligence. In the Veda, the composition of statements is preceded by intelligence, because it is a composition of statements, like the composition of statements accepted by both parties. And this objection by way of dissimilarity, that the composition of the Veda is always perceived to be otherwise, is the same in all inferences. Thus, in the Veda, the word dadāti is preceded by intelligence, because it is said dadāti, like the word dadāti accepted by both parties.

If, even though there is the relation of ‘pervasion and pervaded’, the man with right knowledge were to operate only towards the destruction of Love, etc., then Love, etc. also would operate only towards the destruction of the said knowledge. Thus both would be dependent upon something else. Hence, just as the appearance of the wrong cognition is due to the presence of Love, etc., so also the appearance of the right cognition must be due to the presence of the right knowledge and teaching. The following might be urged: “The man with right knowledge may be the teacher of his pupils; but how could the right knowledge be the cause of the right cognition? because it is not invariably concomitant with it; for instance, even though Devadatta has seen the cow, he does not remember it always; and even when he does remember it, he does not always speak of it; and even when he does speak of it, he does not always make the right assertion.” This is not right. Because, in the case of Devadatta, the memory of the cow is not invariably concomitant with the seeing of the cow; because he is devoid of the right knowledge of the connection between the two. In the case of the man with right knowledge, on the other hand, the memory of the cow is invariably concomitant with the seeing of the cow; because he has the right knowledge of the connection between the two. Thus the invariable concomitance being there, why is it that the memory does not appear? It is because the man does not wish to remember it.

If it is argued that since the cause of the production of false knowledge is perceived in the case of defects like eye disease and jaundice, and in their absence, there is only the non-perception of that, not correct knowledge, it is not so. Because if something that has concomitance and non-concomitance is not a cause, there would be an overextension.

For the purpose of establishing this, it is shown that the validity of other means of knowledge is dependent on something else.

And there is no consequence of the hearer being in suffering, because of the absence of suffering in the composite whole. For only he who has suffering as a part of himself is in suffering, but from the word 'burning' suffering does not arise as a part of the self. Then what? He knows that which arises as a part of the other self from that. But the burning characterized by the sound 'sphoṭa' etc. arises from the connection of the skin with fire, not from the word 'burning'. Therefore, the effect characterized by the sound 'sphoṭa' etc. that arises from the connection of fuel with fire, he experiences that suffering produced by it through the connection of the self with the internal organ, and is therefore called 'in suffering'. And the word 'burning' is understood in a different way by one who has not yet produced the effect characterized by the sound 'sphoṭa' etc., as suffering belonging to the other self. Thus this is not a fault.

Nor is it produced by inference, because the operation of the inferential mark is not perceived.

It would be like this: Wherever you see cowness, there you should use the word 'cow.' And from that, that meaning should be understood. Thus, when the convention is grasped, one understands this is a cow from the perception of a cow-individual, but not this is not a cow, because it would lead to the absurdity of the absence of usage. But there is no contradiction with the sutra, because the word perception indicates a firm means of knowledge. A name is applied to an object delimited by a firm means of knowledge, just as a father, though situated in a different country, is called father by his son.

But we see that even for imperceptible things like the mind, convention is made based on firm knowledge. Similarly, when asked by another person in the forest 'How do you know this is a gavaya?', one simply points to the words 'I was told by someone' and does not say 'I understand by similarity'. And the designation is by the instrument, just as one says 'I understand by the eye' and 'I understand by inference'. Thus, analogy is a means of knowledge with no object to denote. If there is an object of knowledge in the form of a name and its bearer, no. Because the establishment of the relation is the result, it is not possible for the relata to be the object of knowledge. If the establishment of the relata is itself said figuratively to be the relation, since it is based on both, even then the object of knowledge is not in the form of a name and its bearer, because the name does not have that form. If it is argued that the name is uttered by oneself and then applied to the object, and the object is understood through the name, then the name would be the object of knowledge, not the object.

But there would be the knowledge of the relation of the individual delimited by the name as the object of knowledge, because that has both as its object. Similarly, even by the opponent who shows the difference of upamāna from inference, there is no difference because upamāna is established by the conclusion 'as it is', so the form of a sentence is accepted as upamāna.

If it is argued that when there is the apprehension of the qualified object, there is recollection of the counter-correlate, then it must be said that the object qualified by a particular qualifier must be cognized first. Is it cognized by the senses alone, or by another means of knowledge?

Because that is not possible when the means of valid knowledge are not apprehended. For when the absence of the means of valid knowledge that apprehend existence is to be delimited, there is no other means of valid knowledge that delimits it. If it is argued that since the absence of the five means of valid knowledge is manifold, some may be the apprehender of some, then in that case, there would be an infinite regress, as its apprehension would be by another, and that by another. And when the individual means of valid knowledge are manifold, it would not be possible for the restriction to only six to apply to that which is based on them, when they are not apprehended. But for the Vaiśeṣikas, even though the individual means of valid knowledge are infinite, there is a single characteristic that apprehends them, so it is proper to restrict them when the means of valid knowledge are apprehended.

Even though the determinate cognition beginning with 'elephant' was not produced before, still a non-determinate cognition was produced in the temple qualified by the absence of elephant etc. Otherwise, if one were to say 'when I saw the temple, I did not see the elephant nearby', there would be no recollection after the question. But that is seen. For one who has not previously ascertained the absence of an object, there is doubt after the question by another: 'Did I not see whether Devadatta is there or not?' And if one does not ascertain the absence now, the scripture also ascertains the existence of the object in that way by another means of knowledge, not by the instruction of a reliable person, because it is sometimes possible. Therefore, it is proper that this is a recollection, because the absence of elephant etc. was already understood.

And it is not the case that one understands the reason from the words produced by another. The difference is merely in the absence of similarity, as the eyes etc. are also produced by another. Therefore, the conclusion is to be understood from the statement of the reason, because the faults are not possible in the statement of the conclusion. Thus, when the mere reason is understood through the eyes etc., and the conclusion is understood, it is inference for oneself, not accompanied by words.

Thus, perception too, indirectly, would be applicable in the matter of Vedic injunctions. How then can Vedic injunction alone be the means of knowing Dharma? And if it is argued that Vedic injunction alone is the means of knowing Dharma, then there is no contradiction in the restriction.

What is to be inferred is the subject qualified by the property to be proved.

The subject qualified by that is the thesis. Merely stating that, a statement that is not contradicted by perception, etc., and that expresses an uncertain meaning to others is called a thesis. The purpose is the attainment of the object of the reason, which is the means of inference. This is the statement of the purpose. The argument is: The thesis is different from the other [parts of a proof], because it states what is to be inferred, which is not contradicted by perception, etc. But what is not different is not so, like the example, etc. Or, what is to be inferred should be referred to as the thesis, because it states what is to be inferred as stated.

Even without it, the meaning is understood just by the statement of the relation. For example, in the statement Whatever is produced is seen to be impermanent, like a pot, and sound is produced in the same way, the meaning of the conclusion is established by implication alone, so its statement is useless. And here, since the object of knowledge is established by the means of knowledge itself, the nature of the implication should be considered. It cannot be the form of perception, because the object of dispute is not ascertained by the contact of sense with object. The same applies to inference. If implication is just inference, then it necessarily requires the property of the subject and so on for the understanding of the meaning. So without the statement of the conclusion, when the distinction between similar and dissimilar instances is not made, the meaning is not understood, and it is not a means of knowledge. If implication is another kind of inference different from the stated inference, then it does not require invariable concomitance.

And if one says that the pervasion of being produced by impermanence, then he is a true speaker. This is not so. Because the pervasion of being produced and being permanent cannot be demonstrated. And thus, in produced things like pots there is no permanence, and in permanent things like space there is no being produced. Since this is already established by the fault in the example, how can it be contradictory? And when one asserts that sound is permanent and then states the pervasion of being produced and impermanence, then because he states the pervasion in a way contrary to the intended meaning, he is a contradictory speaker.

The mere statement of the probandum is not uncommon, because it is well-known in both similar and dissimilar instances. Similarly, the statement of the probandum is a synonym of the statement of the proposition, so there is no specification of the probandum. If it is argued that the statement of the probandum is not a part of the proof because it is not useful for the probandum, that is also unestablished because it is a statement of the probandum along with other parts. But in the contrary case, it is inconclusive, because even the mere statement of the reason is not a proof. Similarly, the statement of the conclusion is also not a part of the proof, so by saying that, it is contradictory to accept the conclusion.

Just as the meaning of the reason is the cause in the ascertainment of what is to be established, in the same way the meaning of the proposition is the action. Thus, because there is no difference in the causal nature of both, there is no means of valid knowledge in the non-statement of the position.

Although the inferable object to be established does not need to be excluded, since it is worthy of being established and is not contradicted by perception etc., still, when there is a need to know what kind of object is to be established, the phrase not contradicted by perception etc. is used to describe its nature. And this is not correct, because the phrase not contradicted is in apposition with the phrase statement, and because there is no contradiction between the object and the means of knowledge. As Uddyotakara and Pātrasvāmin have said, the object that is perceived as it is is also not perceived as it is. And the thesis is the means of knowledge, so the contradiction is appropriate there.

Since words have the nature of meaning, the definition of indication is stated by way of restating the definition of the mark. That which co-occurs with the inferable object is generally well-known everywhere in things of the same class, such as the property of being smoky. A property that is similar in the subject is well-known in similar instances, but not a specific one, because other properties do not occur elsewhere. And everywhere shows the difference between the all-pervading and non-all-pervading. And in the contrary, which is the opposite of that, it does not exist at all shows the complete exclusion from the contrary, etc. The exclusion of the inconclusive and the contradictory is as before. This is the stated mark. The statement of that is the definition restated. The statement that expresses that, either ending in the instrumental or dative case, is the indication. And thus this differs from the other, because it has the stated mark and statement. But that which does not differ is not so, like the thesis. For example,

The word ca (and) shows another way: from having action and from having qualities. The repetition is for the purpose of showing the connection with the definition. And thus, that having action and having qualities exist in the subject to be inferred, and in all similar instances, in all that belongs to the same class, having qualities exists, and in all that does not belong to the same class, having action exists.

There, this is the general definition: The apparent fallacies are those that appear as if they were fallacies, in a correct cognition. The word in a correct cognition means that even though the reason is non-existent and contradictory, it appears as if it were a reason.

But when the fact that it is a property of the subject is ascertained, he certainly understands the probandum.

Therefore, having seen the mind connected with contradictory means of proof, one doubts whether the mind is material or immaterial. As seen and not as seen.

Therefore, it is said by the opponent that doubt arises from seeing both in both ways, which is not correct. Because doubt arises from seeing the duality of the object. The explanation of this is that in the arising of doubt, the very seeing of the duality of the object is the cause. The duality of the object is seen, so the seeing of the duality of the object is a general characteristic. Or, the duality is the twofoldness of the object, that which has it is said to be so, that is the general characteristic, the seeing of that. Because it is the cause of the continuation of contradictory particulars, it is the cause of doubt, not the combination of contradictory causes. Or, it is the uncommon property. Because the non-apprehension along with the contradictory particulars cannot be the cause of its recollection. And the property that is the cause of the recollection of contradictory particulars is the cause of doubt, not the mutually contradictory equal strength. And in the case of their equal strength, because of their mutual contradiction, it is not the cause of doubt.

Thus, a particular substance with a definite general property, when seen at one time as co-occurring with particularities, is again seen as similar to that, inseparable from other particularities. Therefore, seeing it at another time due to the influence of spatial separation, one doubts: Is this just so, or does it not exist in this way? Similarly, even when having the same substratum, what is seen as it was seen is a substance with a certain general property seen with a certain particularity. What is not seen as it was seen is that same [substance] devoid of the particularity of perception, seen with another particularity. Therefore, because it is seen in both ways, because it is seen with both, when there is no recollection of the absence of both upon perception, doubt arises. For example, having perceived Devadatta with hair, seeing him again without hair, at another time seeing him with his head wrapped, one doubts: Does he have hair or not?

For that [impermanent thing] is not material. In the same probandum, like an atom, this is an example of the absence of the presence of the probandum. Because an atom is permanent.

No, because without this, the fact that the subject is not contradicted is not understood. For the statement of the reason merely presents the mere cause, but does not convey the internal pervasion to one who has grasped the pervasion. For example, by the real, invariably concomitant property of being a substance, which is not contradicted by another means of knowledge, the hand is shown to possess action, and thus the wind is also shown to possess action, conveying the internal pervasion. But without that, even if the external pervasion exists, it is not a means of knowledge.

This is either perception or inference. When from the perception of particulars, knowledge opposed to doubt arises, that is perceptual ascertainment. For example, when from seeing the mere similarity of uprightness in a post and a man, and from the recollection of the particulars of both, the doubt arises Is this a post or a man?, and then from the perception of the particulars of the head, hands, etc., the knowledge of determination This is a man is perceptual ascertainment.

No, because it serves the purpose of defining a particular kind of ascertainment. Although this general definition applies to all kinds of ascertainment, namely, the determinate cognition arising from the perception of a particular, still the word 'contradictory to doubt' serves the purpose of defining ascertainment that is preceded by doubt. And thus it has been stated by the Naiyāyikas: Ascertainment of an object by deliberation through the prima facie view and the counter-view is decision (Nyāya Sūtra). This is the definition of that which is preceded by doubt. 'By deliberation' means after reflection. 'Through the prima facie view and the counter-view' means through those statements. And that is again decision through the proof and the refutation.

Because it arises even when the object is destroyed. And it is not reasonable that a memory-cognition which is not connected with a particular place, time and form should have that as its object, because at the time of memory, that [object] does not exist and cannot be its object. And because of the individual inconstancy of the external sense organs in the production of memory, the operation of the internal organ is ascertained. And since its operation with independence towards an external object is not possible, it is reasonable that [memory] arises from the object itself. And if it must arise from the object, then because of the property of non-deviation etc., it must be said that memory, which has the form of valid cognition, arises from a means of valid cognition. And because the operation of inference etc. is not perceived, if it arises by the independence of the internal organ, then when it is a means of valid cognition, memory would be non-conceptual.

And that is wrong, because of the impossibility of its being non-perceptual. For where there is non-perceptual knowledge, there alone the operation of the sense organ is imagined. And that is not present here. And it has been said that even when the external object is the qualifier, the operation of the mind by itself is not possible. And because of the non-experience of the recollection of the relation between the mark and the marked, it is not inferential. And because it arises even without words, it is not verbal. Therefore, this is the result of a different means of knowledge. Thus, when a question is asked, it does not indicate perception etc., but rather says my heart tells me.

To define the distinctions, it says: Malice, anger, resentment, intolerance, and impatience are the distinctions of hatred, i.e., its specific forms. Malice is the harmfulness towards a master. Anger is that arising from which there is a disturbance of the body and sense faculties. Resentment is the disturbance of the throat and eyes of one who has been harmed but is unable to retaliate.

Why? Because they are produced from causes that are of that form and not of that form. Those that are produced from causes having the form of grain are of that form. Others, which are different, are not of that form. When this is said, he asks: If so, is ignorance accepted as produced from a cause that is not different from consciousness of pleasure etc.? This is not so. When non-difference is to be proved, the fact of being produced from the same cause is also fallacious, depending on the inherent, non-inherent and instrumental causes. For example, the products of cooking arise from a single inherent cause, but are mutually different. But the non-inherent cause is the conjunction of the earth atom and fire for them, and that is the same for all. Similarly, a single hot touch is the instrumental cause for them. Even in relation to that, there is fallacy. The fact of being produced from the same cause is not established in relation to the assemblage, because that is determined for each effect.

Gravity is distinguished from other things by being the cause of the action of falling, while being imperceptible.

Gravity exists only in water and earth, and is the cause of the action of falling. Taste also exists only in water and earth, but is not the cause of falling.

The fact that conjunction and disjunction are produced by action is specified by the phrase that depends on a specific cause. The specific cause is the conjunction of impulsion and contact. The phrase that depends on that means that action is the non-inherent cause. The specific cause of its own effect, such as impulsion, is the instrumental cause.

Others say that motion is also a continuous action in a particular direction. Those who consider the restriction that it is the cause of a continuous action in an unspecified direction to be the original form here, give a different explanation. He states the cause of its destruction: It is opposed to the particular conjunction of a tangible substance.

No, because the destruction is observed by positive and negative concomitance even by the mere conjunction of a tangible substance in the production of multiple effects. And thus, the destruction of the momentum of a thrown arrow must be stated as a necessary cause, because the denial of causeless destruction is established. Therefore, when multiple effects are produced even by conjunction with air, it is contradicted. It is said that the destruction of unseen [forces] is the cause. Sometimes it arises in the order of the qualities of the cause, just as when a conjunction occurs in the falling of a mountain stream, a single water is produced, and momentum arises from the momentum of the cause, like color and so on.

Since the quality of the soul is also present in intellect etc., he says the cause of pleasure, benefit, and liberation. Pleasure is happiness. Benefit is the means to that. Liberation is the complete destruction of the nine specific qualities of the soul. Now, the knowledge of God is also the cause of these, so He is the agent. For the dharma that is performed by someone is the cause of pleasure, benefit, and liberation only there, not so for the knowledge of God. Because it is not an effect, there is no agent. Now, if the knowledge of reality is the cause of the aforementioned fruits for the agent, then it is supersensible for that purpose. Impression also occurs only through memory, therefore it is contradictory to the last blissful consciousness. The last, final, bliss is contradicted by the experience of that.

Inference and scripture. Thus, the effects like the body and universe are preceded by the qualities of the soul, because they are diverse effects, like a chariot etc. Just as the maker of a chariot etc., while expecting the diverse intentions of the enjoyer, creates that construction accordingly, so also the maker of the body etc. And before the origin of the body, the intellect etc. do not exist in the soul like us. But the impression, whose efficacy is known only in the production of memory, while expecting another quality in it, creates the diverse body etc. for the accomplishment of its enjoyment. As for scripture, it says as long as virtue and vice exist in the soul, so long does life, body, senses and objects exist. Thus, his actions are exhausted.

For when the intellect is merged in prakriti at the time of dissolution, dharma and adharma are not manifest, and the transformation of prakriti into intellect etc. would not occur, because manifest action is accepted as the cause. And manifest action cannot be the cause from the beginning, because it is said to be manifest only when located in the intellect. And it cannot be said that the transformation of prakriti into intellect etc. is due to the manifestation of dharma and adharma, because there is no specific cause for that. And if it is accepted that action performed by the intellect etc. produces enjoyment for the agent, then it would produce enjoyment for all liberated souls without distinction, because there is no cause for restriction. And it would operate to produce body etc. even for a liberated soul, because there is no distinction, and thus there would be the undesirable consequence of his being a transmigrating being. And the non-apprehension of the distinction between the qualities and the purusha cannot be the cause of the operation of prakriti, because it has already been refuted.

Even there, if it is non-eternal, the objection is that no effect which is not dependent and is a real entity is possible. But if it is eternal, then the performance of sacrifices and other actions would be meaningless. If it is argued that the effect is the manifestation of the action, then in that case, due to momentariness, the action would be destroyed and heaven and other fruits would not result. And the action does not manifest like a lamp, i.e. it does not illuminate itself. Because even when it exists, it is not perceived. If it is argued that the action of sacrifice etc. generates the potency of Dharma, then that potency itself is Dharma. And what is dependent on that is the Self. So it would be mere verbal difference. Similarly, because the formless Self cannot be related to anything, there would be no fruit related to it. Enough of digression. And action is not of the nature of consciousness. Because if difference is not accepted, then due to being of the nature of consciousness, there would be no diversity in the world, as there would be no difference anywhere.

The duties of one dwelling there are serving the teacher, kindling the sacred fire, and going on alms rounds. Serving the teacher is attending to him. Kindling the sacred fire is bringing fuel for the fire. A collection of alms is alms. Going on alms rounds. Avoiding honey, meat, daytime sleep, collyrium, anointing, etc. But this is for each Veda, so the study vow would last for twelve years, making forty-eight years.

Among them, the Vartāvṛttis, engaging in agriculture, trade, and so on, which are not censured by the scriptures, worship with rites lasting for a hundred years, perform sacrifices, and seek their own self. The Śālīnavṛttis, while worshipping and performing sacrifices, giving and receiving, seek their own self with rites lasting for a hundred years. The Yāyāvaras, while studying but not teaching, worshipping but not performing sacrifices, giving but not receiving, seek their own self.

They endure all, are equal to all, and consider a clod, a stone, and gold as equal.

That which has knowledge as the basis is said to be so. What kind of [Dharma]? From that which has an unseen result. It is said to be so because it has a result that is not imagined in this way: May my body, senses, and objects be accomplished in this way, not in this way. From that, birth occurs in a pure family. For one who is born thus, the desire to know the means of removing suffering arises. How can one attain complete separation from the continuum of suffering? Thus, the desire to know leads to approaching a teacher. Having approached him, one learns the means of turning away from the continuum of suffering. From the knowledge of reality, one attains the highest good. Then, from the practice of the scriptures, the knowledge of the truth of the six categories arises. For one who has attained the knowledge of the six categories, the cessation of ignorance occurs. With its cessation, detachment arises. The cause of that is the knowledge of the truth of the six categories.

It is perceptible by the ear. It is momentary. It is opposed to both cause and effect. It arises from the sound of conjunction and disjunction. It occurs in a limited space. It has causes of the same and different kinds. It is of two kinds: characterized by letters and characterized by sound. Among them, the letter a etc. is characterized by letters. The sound from a conch etc. is characterized by sound. Among them, the production of the letter-characterized sound is as follows: From the conjunction of the self and the mind, depending on memory, there is a desire to utter the letter. After that, there is effort. Depending on that, from the conjunction of the self and air, action arises in the air. And that, going upwards, strikes the throat etc. Then, depending on the conjunction of the place and air, from the conjunction of the place and space, the letter arises. The sound characterized by letters also arises from the conjunction of the drum and stick, depending on the conjunction of the drum and space. From the separation of the joints of the bamboo and the separation of the space in the bamboo, and from the sound produced by the conjunction and disjunction, there is a continuum of sound like a stream of water.

The cognition of the hearer arises as I heard that sound and now I hear it again, and is perceived. And this is not unestablished, because there is no perception of a valid cognition apprehending difference. Similarly, the eternality of sound is known through presumption. For if it were non-eternal, the understanding of its meaning through convention would not occur due to the perception of a different sound after the cessation of the sound experienced at the time of convention.

And the apprehension of space, time, etc. is not seen to be by the operation of the ear. If [the definition] is included in the totality of the means of knowledge, then even if the means of knowledge is different, the object of knowledge remains the same, so [the cognition] would have only a known object as its content.

But even so, there is the contingence of the apprehension of all sounds, for when the ear is modified, all [sounds] are present. And it cannot be said that the air impelled for the manifestation of the word 'cow' does not manifest the word 'horse', because no restriction is found in the manifesters. Just as a lamp produced for the manifestation of a pot manifests objects of the same sense-organ and the same location. Thus, the ear is not modified by a modification restricted to itself, because it manifests objects of the same sense-organ and the same location, like the eye. The knowledge of the difference from the place occupied by the lamp is produced by the lamp-modified eye, but not by the eye alone.

And it is accepted that even in the case of establishing variegated colors, there can be multiple substrata in the earth. This is true. Nevertheless, the non-apprehension of color differences is due to the absence of cooperating factors. And it has been said that the sense faculty, which is the cooperating factor in the perception of the various colored parts, is the apprehender of the variegated color in the whole, when it exists, because of the variegated appearance. And in this way, for the ear, which is modified by air, there is no cause for non-apprehension of all sounds due to their presence there. But universals are manifested by specific manifesters, and they are not located in the same place, because they are omnipresent in their own objects, so there is no counterexample. Similarly, the manifestation of smell in heated iron is due to contact with heat. But at the end of summer, it is due to contact with the first stream of rain on burnt ground. And it is not the case that the smell is destroyed by heat, because it is not perceived even when the heat subsides.

And this is not so. Because the sound of the lute, etc. is sometimes perceived to be overwhelmed by the sound of the donkey. And this relation of the overwhelmed and the overwhelm is not possible in the case of eternal entities, because the difference of being more intense, etc. is not possible. And the non-perception of the faint sound is the overwhelming of the sound, when the more intense sound is perceived. And the non-perception of one sound due to the perception of another by a more intense manifestor is not possible. Because no restriction is perceived in the manifestors, as has been said. And this notion of the sound being intense or faint is based on the same cognition as the notion of the sound itself. It is not based on the notion of the manifestor. So how can the property of the manifestor, such as being more intense, etc., be inferred from the perception of one sound and the non-perception of another? Thus, because of the difference of being more intense, etc., like pleasure, etc., sound is non-eternal. And because of the perception of coming into existence after non-existence when the manifestor is not perceived, sound is a product, because of the relation of invariable concomitance with that.

Sound is a quality, because it is related to existence, while being different from substance and action, like color and so on. And what has been said that the eternality of sounds is known by the impossibility of the cognition of meaning in any other way, that is wrong. Because even if they are non-eternal, when similarity is adopted, the cognition of meaning occurs. Wherever you perceive such a sequence of the letters ga, ō, and sa, there the meaning qualified by the word go should be understood and communicated. When the convention is grasped in this way, perceiving such a sound, one understands that meaning and communicates it.

The inherence characterized by being an action. And thus upacaya etc. are to be spoken of as actions, because of the relation of being an action. Being possessed of one substance. One and a substance is one substance. It has that, so it is possessed of one substance. The state of that is being possessed of one substance. One action occurs in only one substance. Similarly, only one occurs in only one. How is this known? Because when one moves, the movement of all is not perceived. Even where many move at the same time, there too it is only multiplicity, because the cause, such as impact, is different for each. Others say that the action of moving is one, because the action of moving is not perceived in the parts of the moving substance.

And this is an example, because it arises from other causes as well. And weight etc. are separate, even though they produce other effects, not other than action when combined. So it is unique. And it is not merely dissimilar, pervading all actions. Or it is intended that it is produced by any one of the causes such as weight etc. And it is opposed to conjunction with its own effect. The word 'own' is used because destruction is not seen merely by conjunction. And action is also the effect of disjunction and velocity. To prevent fallacy there, conjunction is grasped.

For qualities there are two kinds: non-inherence and instrumentality. And for motion etc. there is only the property of being the non-inherent cause, not a second kind. Thus there is complete exclusion from the contrary. Because the negation of a second kind is intended. Similarly, the property of producing an effect inhering in itself and in another. The action which inheres in a substratum produces disjunction and conjunction inhering in that substratum and in another substratum. It does not produce an effect of the same kind. And such an action is seen to produce disjunction and conjunction when produced, not another action. Because the negation of many actions in one substratum is already established. The property of not producing a substance - action does not produce a substance.

Why? Because of the non-distinction in motion. The objection is that there is no distinction due to the non-distinction in motion. He says this: All is momentary.

Even though there is a difference in the higher and lower distinctions of existence, substantiality, etc., in a single manifest entity, still cowhood and horsehood, etc., are not observed.

He says: The conditions of going out and entering in are seen simultaneously in a single action-manifest entity by two observers. Whose is that action?

When two persons are stationed there, and one person goes to the other, due to the perception of a specific conjunction and disjunction, the conditions of going out and entering in are seen simultaneously.

For when a specific thing is seen, the indication of a general term at that time of counting is not seen, just as the indication of a substance is not seen at the time of indicating earth etc. Therefore, due to the perception of a property with both forms, and due to the non-perception of a specific thing etc., the doubt should be raised: Is 'going' a higher universal like 'action', or is it a lower universal like 'throwing up' etc.? Doubt should not be raised. 'Going' is a synonym like 'self' and 'person', because it is a synonym of 'action'. Because the notion of 'going' is perceived everywhere like the notion of 'action', according to the principle. Then, why is 'going' mentioned by a specific term? Because the indication of a general term is not seen at the time of indicating a specific thing. No, because it serves to exclude 'circling' etc.

It does not exist in throwing upwards and other actions. How then is there the usage of going in those? He says: The word going should be seen as figurative in throwing upwards and other actions. Why? From the seed of figurative usage, from the commonality of being the cause of conjunctions and disjunctions with its substratum. Just as throwing upwards and other actions that have arisen cause conjunctions and disjunctions of their substratum with other things, so does going. And from this very reason, there is no consequence of the usage of going in throwing upwards and other actions, nor the usage of throwing upwards and other actions in going, because the postulation of a cause is based on the existence of an effect. And the usage of throwing upwards and other actions in going is not seen as the usage of going in throwing upwards and other actions. Therefore, this is not a matter of dispute. Now, from the presentation of two positions, what is intended here by the teacher? The five actions have the nature of being the cause of conjunctions and disjunctions with their substratum. They are not the cause of conjunctions and disjunctions with other things.

There, how is the injunction of action with good conditions? He says: in what is desired to be done, what is wished to be done, in sacrifices, study, giving, agriculture, etc. By the word 'etc.' the inclusion of eating, etc. is meant. And in sacrifices, etc., when one desires to raise one's hand for the purpose of taking sesamum seeds, or to lower it, then an effort arises in the part of the body that has a hand. At its origin, the self is the inherent cause. The conjunction of the self and mind is the non-inherent cause. Desire is the instrumental cause.

Anticipating this doubt, he says: Even though the previous momentum is destroyed, the connection of the pestle and mortar produces a strong action. Why?

Impulsion is the particular conjunction that does not depend on heaviness, fluidity, effort and speed, either collectively or individually. It is the cause of action not produced by mutual non-separation. If it is said that conjunction is impulsion, there is over-extension. Therefore, it is said 'the cause of action'. Impact also occurs in this way. Therefore, the word 'not produced by mutual non-separation' is used. Even so, action that has arisen necessarily produces separation.

Since downward movement of air is also possible in the hollows of trees and other places by entering from above, to exclude that, it says due to gravity. The phrase of earth and water defines the substratum. The substratum of falling is the inherent cause. Gravity is the non-inherent cause. The phrase when there is absence of contact that holds gravity, effort, and velocity shows the instrumental cause. The example is such as in a hammer, body, etc. Falling occurs in a hammer due to the absence of contact between hand and hammer, in a body due to the absence of effort, and in a spinning object due to the absence of velocity. There, the first falling arises from gravity alone, which is the non-inherent cause. And that which has arisen produces a modification dependent on its cause.

And also due to heaviness etc. Thus, the rotation is said to occur only due to impression.

For the directions and places are indeed specific, occupied by the wheel. When conjunctions and disjunctions are to be made with them, the action that arises in the whole is due to impression. Why?

In the wind called prāṇa, how does action arise? He says: It arises from the conjunction of the self and wind, which is the non-inherent cause, in dependence on effort preceded by desire and aversion. What is qualified? He says: of one who is awake. Why is this? Because of the observed conformity with desire. Exhalation is from the desire to exhale, and inhalation is from the desire to inhale. But for one who is asleep, action arises in the wind called prāṇa from the conjunction of the self and wind, which is the non-inherent cause, in dependence on effort preceded by life. What is the evidence here? The inference is that action in the wind is from effort preceded by life in one who is asleep. This is because the action of the wind in one who is asleep is the effect of effort, because it is the action of the wind that is accepted, like the action of that wind in the waking state. And where no other cause is perceived by perception or inference, there the cause is only unseen. And here, the establishment of being the effect of effort by inference is not contradicted by desire.

But if the quality of being a conjoin is to be proved, it follows that the universal has the nature of substance. And that is not proper. Because what is related to qualities and actions is perceived. And the conjunction of substance is only with substance, not elsewhere. And so, because of the absence of co-existence. And conjunction is of co-existent things. Now, if mere relation with the universal is to be proved, then also it is the proving of what is already established, because the conjunction of what is conjoined with its own substratum exists everywhere.

Thus, it conceals the different forms of those [objects] and grasps its own non-different form, combining and displaying them. And that is called the universal, appearing externally as if it were the means and object of cognition of only the things existing in the intellect. And that is said to be the object of particulars, because it exists in things other than itself, but not ultimately. Therefore, the universal and the particular are [so called] because of their inclusive and exclusive forms, but external differentiated things are not. And how does conceptual cognition occur in them? Indeed, investigators analyze in this way through universals, but not the people engaged in worldly transactions. They, considering the cognition having its own object as having a form that is inclusive, as if it were an external form, identify the seen and the imagined objects and engage in activity and communicate.

It is concluded that this is stated by those blinded by hatred towards universals, who have fallen from the path of valid cognition. Indeed, due to the operation of the eye etc., the cognition of the universal, which is not contradicted, must be explained to have an invariable cause. And the impression alone cannot be the cause, because it has already been refuted earlier. And if the impression is the cause of a particular cognition and is external, then there would be only a difference in name. But if it is included in cognition, then due to the non-difference of that in the form of cognition everywhere, there would be no variety of conceptualization, such as the conceptualization in the form of a cow from seeing a cow, and the conceptualization of a horse from seeing a horse, and so on. And even when the conceptualization is not contradicted by the difference of place etc., it cannot be without an object. Thus, the one by which the external form is concealed by one's own form, is the impression. This is refuted.

And if the universal were non-existent because it is not manifested in the cognition of the excluded [particular], then the particular itself would be non-existent because it is not manifested in the cognition of the inclusive [universal]. Therefore, just as the blue and so on are existent because they are manifested in the cognition that is not contradicted, so the existence of the universal also should be accepted because it is manifested in the inclusive cognition. Because the objections based on the impossibility of inherence, the alternatives regarding inherence, and so on are not valid.

For this very reason, when the universal is perceived in one individual qualified by place etc., there is no possibility of the perception of even that qualified by all the particulars, because they are not perceived as connected with an indefinite direction and place. And just as the particulars are perceived in sequence, the universal qualified by them is also perceived in the same way. For when the individual cows present in the market are perceived in the spring season, qualified by the particular states of youth etc., then the universal qualified by them is perceived. At other times, it is qualified by others. Thus, the universal's ability to generate cognition following the individuals everywhere is its invariable nature. Therefore, the universal, which is of the nature of non-difference and exists in many, should be accepted as perceived by perception, just as form, which is one only, is perceived by perception as existing in one place, so also the universal is one, though existing in many.

Because in the presence of an annulment, the cognition of motion is figurative. And thus activity is pervaded by corporeality.

And it has been said on the occasion of establishing pervasion that smoke is not an indicator by its being an effect. Therefore, one who desires inference, because of the establishment of invariable concomitance of universals, must necessarily accept universals. Otherwise, without real universals, because of the non-establishment of entities, and because of the non-understanding of conventions, inference and verbal testimony would not be valid means of knowledge. But they are valid. Therefore, it has been said before that for one engaged in understanding objects, by the agreement with effective action, there is the cessation of disagreement, and the cessation of the error which is pervaded by that.

The explanation of 'in one, two, or many' is 'in the substrates'. But the word 'non-difference' is explained by 'due to the non-difference of its own nature'. The question 'how?' is not well-formed. Or it is a contrary supposition. And thus, at the time of the perception of one individual, the universal is not perceived as continuous. Even at the time of the perception of the second individual, due to the non-apprehension of the first individual, there is indeed an absence of the cognition of continuity. Even where a single cognition has many individuals as its object, there too, the cognition of continuity is indeed not perceived. When this supposition is made, the reply is given beginning with 'depending on the universal in each individual'.

Or, what was previously stated as perception is now stated as inference. There, in order to establish the pervasion, he explains the example. Just as in mutually distinct, excluded things like leather, cloth, blanket, etc., the cognition of blue as blue, due to the connection with a blue substance that is a different object from another, similarly in mutually distinct substances, qualities, and actions, the cognition of existence as existence is not distinct. This is the explanation of the example. And that cognition of existence can arise from the connection with a different object. That which is a different object is established as existence. Due to the connection with existence, there is the cognition of existence as existence. Therefore, it is a universal.

This is not so, because of the appearance as having a different nature from substance etc., it is a different category. And for this very reason it is permanent, because the causes of origination and destruction are not possible. Thus, there is no cause of origination for the universal, because of the impossibility of its substrata simultaneously, due to the absence of an inherent cause. Thus it has been determined in the confusion of categories.

The restriction of manifestation is as follows: substantiality exists only in substances, quality exists only in qualities, etc. The difference in cognitions is as follows: in substances alone, the cognition is substance, substance due to substantiality, and in qualities, the cognition is quality, quality due to the connection with quality. Therefore, because of the restriction of manifestation in substances etc. and because of the difference in cognitions, there is difference from each other.

Even so, in their own substrata, the cognition of substance as 'substance' is due to the universal 'substance', and in qualities etc. as 'quality' etc. Since this is so, is it one or many? To remove this doubt, he says: 'The universal substance is one in each of its own substrata. The universal quality is one in qualities. Thus it is in the rest also.' Why is this so? Because of the non-difference of the characteristic. Because of the non-difference of the pervasive form. Or, that by which something is characterized is the characteristic.

Therefore he says, and because there is no specific characteristic, there is oneness. Now, for a pot etc. that arises in the same place, a reason for the connection with a specific universal must be stated. Otherwise, because the universals have no fixed location, there would be no connection with a limited object. Therefore he says, although the universals are not delimited in space, still they are all-pervading with respect to their own objects due to the restriction of the indicator and the restriction of the assemblage of causes. That by which something is indicated is the indicator, which is the cognition that pervades. For example, the cognition 'substance is substance' pervades only substances, not qualities etc. Therefore substantiality pervades only its own object.

When there is no restriction, the relation with a restricted substratum itself would be impossible, hence he says: and because of the restriction of the assemblage of causal factors, the all-pervasiveness of the object with respect to its own domain. It is like this: the individual cow, produced by the assemblage characterized by unseen [forces] that bring about the experience related to the universal cowness, is not the other, the horse etc. Because of that restriction, only that is related to cowness, not another. Similarly, the individual horse is related to horsemanship because it is produced by the assemblage characterized by unseen [forces] that bring about the experience related to the universal horseness. It is the same in other cases as well. Therefore, what was said - It is related to that where it exists, not to the other etc. - is refuted.

Since the universal such as cowness is perceived by inherence in the conjoined, it is designated as cowness. But this is not present here. Therefore, it is inexpressible. Similarly, what is this space between, where the perception of the universal is suspected and objected to?

Similarly, there is the origination of earth etc. up to space. From the point of view of the text, that also is denoted by the word 'anta' (end).

Inference. To establish the pervasion, he presents an example: Just as we see that for us, the notion of a cow is excluded from horses and others, and is due to the conjunction of parts that perform the same function as those of similar kind, even if they have similar form and qualities. There, the notion that excludes others is due to the universal. Because this is a cow, therefore it is different from horses and so on. Even if it belongs to the same class, the notion that excludes others is due to being white, related to the quality of black and so on. Similarly, the notion of moving quickly is due to a particular action. By that, even if it exists, it is excluded from those of the same class that have the same qualities and actions. The notion of being fat is due to the accumulation of parts. By that, even if it exists, it is excluded from those of the same class that have the same qualities and actions. The notion of having a dewlap is due to a particular part. By that, even if it exists, it generates a notion that is different from others. The notion of having a large bell is due to conjunction.

This one is different, this one is different - this is seen. And that distinction arises only from the connection with a particular, because another cause is not possible. And thus, atoms are the substrata of similar form, quality, and action, and are connected with a particular, because they are the objects of a distinguishing cognition, like a cow etc. And it cannot be said that the particulars are only of the nature of class, quality, and action, like in the case of a cow etc. Because they are specified as the substrata of similar class, quality, and action. Even so, all fiery atoms are the substrata of similar qualities and the substrata of similar actions connected with fireness, being the subject. Therefore, there is no distinction in cognition caused by that in them. And thus, the luminous form, the hot touch, the dimension, the oneness, the one-ness, the separateness etc. are common.

Inference itself. Thus, atoms etc. are the objects of differentiating cognition. Because they are substances, like a cow etc. And the object of doubt is atoms etc., because they are related to existence, like a post etc. And where there is doubt, there must be determination. Therefore, atoms etc. are related to particulars. Because they are the objects of determination, like a post etc. For this reason, he says: Because other causes are not possible, those causes from which there is the exclusion of the cognition 'this is different, this is different', those are the ultimate particulars. Similarly, the cognition this is the same regarding an unseen atom far removed in space and time is evidence. Because recognition occurs when there is a relation to a particular, as is observed in Devadatta etc. Therefore, because atoms etc. are the objects of differentiating cognition and are recognized, they are related to particulars.

Because even when that is perceived, doubt is seen in the case of a post etc. Indeed, when mutual absence is perceived and distinctness is perceived, doubt is seen as to whether this is a post or a man, due to the perception of a universal etc. And when the specific features like head, hands etc. different from that are perceived, certainty is seen as this is a man, so a difference other than mutual absence and distinctness should be stated in the case of an atom etc.

And when the object of the cognition of exclusion is the same, there is no reason to say that this relation to the object is only of atoms, not of specificities. And if it is accepted, then even in atoms, without the relation of another specificity to the specificities, there would be a cognition of exclusion. Therefore he says: If it is so, why is the exclusion of cognition not imagined in atoms as in the ultimate specificities? To counter this, he says: What was said - the absence of specificities in atoms, and another specificity in specificities - is not so. Why is this? Because of identity. Because the specificities have that as their nature. Those which have the nature of non-specificity require another specificity for the production of an exclusive cognition, like atoms and so on. But the specificities are not so, they do not have that as their nature. They are not non-specificities. They are specificities. Therefore they do not require another specificity for the production of an exclusive cognition. Thus the specificities are not related to another specificity. Therefore the specificities are not related to another specificity. Therefore the specificities are not related to another specificity. Therefore the specificities are not related to another specificity. Therefore the specificities are not related to another specificity.

Just as there is a restriction of container and contained even in the oneness of the conjunction of a pot and curd, similarly, even in the oneness of inherence of substantiveness, etc., there is a restriction of substratum and superstratum due to the difference in the power of the manifested and manifester.

Conjunction is not possible, because it is a quality and inheres in substances. Nor is inherence itself, because it is one. And there is no other mode. No, because of identity. Just as for substances, qualities and actions, which are of the nature of existence, there is no other connection with existence, similarly for inherence, which is of the nature of non-division, there is no other mode. Therefore it inheres in itself. For this very reason it is imperceptible, because like existence etc., there is no mode in perceptible things, and because there is no self-awareness in itself. Therefore inherence is to be inferred here by the intellect.

The relation of only those that are not produced simultaneously, which are the supported and the supporter, is inherence. This definition has been explained. Now, he says, this relation is of those that are not produced simultaneously, namely, substance, quality, action, universal and particular. For the sake of showing the absence of restriction, it is said to be of cause and effect such as cloth etc. No, it is of those that are not cause and effect, such as the universal and its possessor. This restriction is that the relation of inherence is the state of being the supported and the supporter of those that are not produced simultaneously. And this relation called inherence is the cause of the cognition this in that. And the aphorism is: That inherence of cause and effect, which is the basis of the cognition 'this in that'. Here means the substratum. This means the superstratum. Without the relation of those two, the cognition this in that does not occur. And because it is of those that are not all-pervading, this suspected restriction is refuted.

Inherence cannot subsist between two things that are not accomplished, because a relation is never seen to subsist between non-entities. If, on the other hand, inherence is the relation between two accomplished things, then the two things must be simultaneous. Similarly, if inherence is not admitted to be a relation, then, as there is no difference between the two relata and all other things, there is no reason why inherence should subsist between these two and not between other things. Or, a perceived object is the cause of the cognition of a qualified object, and an inferential mark is the cause of the cognition of an inferred object. But inherence is not of the nature of either of these, so there is no means of knowing it. For instance, the cognition 'the cloth is in the yarns' qualifies the substratum as affected by what is to be added, but not as affected by inherence. As there is no self-awareness of what is in the self, inherence is not directly perceived in this cognition. In indeterminate cognition,
