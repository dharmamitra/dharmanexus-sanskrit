The treatise on the teaching of yoga should be known to be authoritative. Yoga is concentration.

The states of the mind are: distracted, deluded, scattered, one-pointed, and restrained.

But when the mind is one-pointed, it illuminates the real object and destroys the afflictions and the bonds of karma.

The mind, being of the nature of manifestation, activity, and stability, consists of the three guṇas.

That same [sattva], with the obscuration of delusion removed,

That is called supreme reflection by the meditators. The power of consciousness is unchanging, not subject to transmigration,

Therefore, the mind, detached from that [knowledge of discrimination], stops even that knowledge. Remaining in that state, it becomes

That is seedless concentration. Since nothing is known there, it is called the state of non-apprehension. It is of two kinds,
['SA_GSP34_patyogbu-22']	sa yogaś cittavṛttinirodha iti / /	sa yogaḥ citta vṛtti nirodhaḥ iti 	that yoga is the cessation of the modifications of the mind.

['SA_GSP34_patyogbu-24']	tadā draṣṭuḥ svarūpe 'vasthānam // / //	tadā draṣṭuḥ svarūpe vasthānam 	Then the seer abides in its own nature.

But when the mind of worldly engagement is present, although it exists in that way, it is not so.
['SA_GSP34_patyogbu-26']	kathaṃ tarhi /	katham tarhi 	How then?
['SA_GSP34_patyogbu-27']	darśitaviṣayatvāt 	darśita viṣaya tvāt 	Because the object has been shown,

And thus the aphorism (is to be explained): The one vision is the same as the manifestation.

The mind, which is like a magnet, is the self of the Purusha, the master, by being the object of vision, and it is helpful merely by its presence. And therefore, in the manifestation of the modifications of the mind, the beginningless connection is the cause of the Purusha.

The undefiled ones are those that are opposed to the objects of manifestation and the functions of the qualities.

The modifications that are of the same kind as these are produced by the modifications themselves. The residua are produced by the modifications.

The result is the arousal of a human modification of the mind, which is not distinguished [from the means of valid knowledge].
