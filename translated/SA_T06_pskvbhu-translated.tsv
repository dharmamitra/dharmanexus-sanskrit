['SA_T06_pskvbhu-1']	namo buddhāya // pañca skandhā ityādi prakaraṇārambhaḥ /	namaḥ buddhāya pañca skandhāḥ ityādi prakaraṇa ārambhaḥ 	Homage to the Buddha. The beginning of the chapter is The five aggregates, etc.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-2']	sa ca dharmasvasāmānyalakṣaṇavyutpattyartham /	sa ca dharma sva sāmānya lakṣaṇa vyutpatti artham 	And that is for the purpose of understanding the specific and general characteristics of dharmas.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-3']	nanu ca yogācārabhūmyādiṣu śāstreṣu dharmalakṣaṇaṃ nirdhāritam eveti punas tannirdhāraṇāya yatnavaiyarthyam /	nanu ca yoga ācāra bhūmi ādiṣu śāstreṣu dharma lakṣaṇam nirdhāritam eva iti punar tad nirdhāraṇāya yatna vaiyarthyam 	But since the characteristics of dharmas have already been determined in treatises such as the Yogācārabhūmi, it is pointless to make an effort to determine them again.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-4']	na vaiyarthyam udghaṭitajñavineyārthitvāt /	na vaiyarthyam udghaṭita jña vineya arthi tvāt 	It is not pointless, because it is for the sake of disciples who understand what is implied.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-5']	udghaṭitajñā hi diṅmātreṇa tatsambhavino viśeṣān niravaśeṣān avaboddhuṃ samarthā iti saṅkṣepoktim eva bahu manyante /	udghaṭita jñāḥ hi diś mātreṇa tad sambhavinaḥ viśeṣān niravaśeṣān avaboddhum samarthāḥ iti saṅkṣepa uktim eva bahu manyante 	For those who understand what is implied are able to understand all the remaining specific details by just a hint, so they value a concise statement more.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-6']	na vistaroktim /	na vistara uktim 	Not an extensive statement.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-7']	ataś ca saṅkṣiptarucisattvānugrahāyedaṃ prakaraṇam ārabdham iti /	atas ca saṅkṣipta ruci sattva anugrahāya idam prakaraṇam ārabdham iti 	And therefore this chapter is begun for the sake of favoring beings who delight in conciseness.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-8']	athavā gṛhasthānāṃ bahukṛtyavyāpṛtatvād vistaragrantheṣv abhiyogāsambhavaḥ /	athavā gṛhasthānām bahu kṛtya vyāpṛta tvāt vistara grantheṣu abhiyoga asambhavaḥ 	Or else, because householders are occupied with many duties, it is impossible for them to apply themselves to extensive texts.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-9', 'SA_T06_pskvbhu-10', 'SA_T06_pskvbhu-11']	manasikārābhiyuktānāṃ ca pravrajitānām api vistaragranthābhiyogo vikṣepāyaivety ubhayeṣām api dharmalakṣaṇavyutpattyartham iha prakaraṇe dharmalakṣaṇaṃ 🔽samāsenoktam iti nāsti tadārambhavaiyarthyam /🔽athavā saṅkṣepeṇa dharmalakṣaṇavyutpannā ayatnena dharmalakṣaṇavistarapratipattisamarthā bhaviṣyantīty ato yogācārabhūmyādīnāṃ vistaragranthānāṃ 	manasikāra abhiyuktānām ca pravrajitānām api vistara grantha abhiyogaḥ vikṣepāya eva iti ubhayeṣām api dharma lakṣaṇa vyutpatti artham iha prakaraṇe dharma lakṣaṇam  samāsena uktam iti na asti tad ārambha vaiyarthyam  athavā saṅkṣepeṇa dharma lakṣaṇa vyutpannāḥ ayatnena dharma lakṣaṇa vistara pratipatti samarthāḥ bhaviṣyanti iti atas yoga ācāra bhūmi ādīnām vistara granthānām 	stated concisely for the sake of generating understanding of the characteristics of dharmas in both [types of people]. Thus, the undertaking of this [treatise] is not pointless.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-12']	praveśabhūtam idam ācāryeṇa prakaraṇaṃ kṛtam iti /	praveśa bhūtam idam ācāryeṇa prakaraṇam kṛtam iti 	Or else, those who have become proficient in the characteristics of dharmas through [this] concise [treatise] will be able to understand the extensive characteristics of dharmas without effort. Therefore, the Master has composed this treatise as an introduction to the extensive texts such as the Yogācārabhūmi.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-13']	kiṃ punar dharmalakṣaṇavyutpattyā vinā na sidhyati yatrācāryo dharmalakṣaṇanirdeśaṃ praty ādriyate /	kim punar dharma lakṣaṇa vyutpattyā vinā na sidhyati yatra ācāryaḥ dharma lakṣaṇa nirdeśam prati ādriyate 	What, then, is not accomplished without becoming proficient in the characteristics of dharmas, for which the Master is concerned with teaching the characteristics of dharmas?
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-14']	cittaikāgratā sāṅkathyaviniścayeṣu ca praśnap / vyākaraṇakauśalam /	citta ekāgra tā sāṅkathya viniścayeṣu ca vyākaraṇa kauśalam 	One-pointedness of mind and skill in answering questions in doctrinal discussions.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-15']	tathā hi dharmalakṣaṇakṛtaparicayasya sandehābhāvād yatheṣṭam ālambane cittam ekāgrībhavati nānyathā /	tathā hi dharma lakṣaṇa kṛta paricayasya sandeha abhāvāt yathā iṣṭam ālambane cittam ekāgrībhavati na anyathā 	For thus, one whose familiarity with the characteristics of dharmas is complete lacks doubt and can focus the mind on a chosen object as desired, not otherwise.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-16']	dharmalakṣaṇapravicayāc ca prajñāprakarṣagamanād vaiśāradyaṃ pratilabhate /	dharma lakṣaṇa pravicayāt ca prajñā prakarṣa gamanāt vaiśāradyam pratilabhate 	And by discriminating the characteristics of dharmas, one attains fearlessness through the advancement of wisdom.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-17']	viśāradaś ca sāṅkathyaviniścayeṣu sarvapraśnatadvyākaraṇanirdeśasamartho bhavati nānyathā //	viśāradaḥ ca sāṅkathya viniścayeṣu sarva praśna tad vyākaraṇa nirdeśa samarthaḥ bhavati na anyathā 	And being fearless, one becomes capable of answering all questions and explaining them in discussions and determinations, not otherwise.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-18']	pañca skandhā iti nyūnātiriktapratiṣedhena saṅkhyāvadhāraṇam /	pañca skandhāḥ iti nyūna atirikta pratiṣedhena saṅkhyā avadhāraṇam 	Five aggregates is a determination of number by negating less or more.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-19']	nirviśeṣaṇaskandhaśabdaprayogāt sāsravānāsravaskandhopādānam /	nirviśeṣaṇa skandha śabda prayogāt sa āsrava anāsrava skandha upādānam 	The inclusion of contaminated and uncontaminated aggregates is due to the use of the word aggregate without qualification.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-20']	pañcaiva skandhā na nyūnā adhikā vā /	pañca eva skandhāḥ na nyūnāḥ adhikāḥ vā 	There are only five aggregates, neither less nor more.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-21']	ātmātmīyagrāhavastupradarśanārtham /	ātma ātmīya grāha vastu pradarśana artham 	This is to show the basis for grasping self and what belongs to self.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-22']	prāyeṇa hi bālānāṃ vijñāna evātmagrāhaḥ /	prāyeṇa hi bālānām vijñāne eva ātma grāhaḥ 	For generally, the ignorant grasp consciousness itself as the self.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-23']	śeṣeṣu rūpādiṣv ātmīyagrāhaḥ /	śeṣeṣu rūpa ādiṣu ātmīya grāhaḥ 	In the remaining [aggregates] such as form, they grasp what belongs to the self.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-24']	tathā hi bāhyādhyātmikasya rūpasya karaṇatvena karmatvena vātmanā sambandha iti rūpaskandha ātmīyagrāhaḥ /	tathā hi bāhya ādhyātmikasya rūpasya karaṇa tvena karma tvena vā ātmanā sambandhaḥ iti rūpa skandhaḥ ātmīya grāhaḥ 	Thus, the form aggregate is grasped as what belongs to the self, because external and internal form is related to the self as an instrument or as an object.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-25']	śubhāśubhānāṃ karmaṇāṃ vedanā vipākaḥ /	śubha aśubhānām karmaṇām vedanā vipākaḥ 	Feeling is the result of good and bad actions.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-26']	tāṃ cātmā saṃvedayata iti vedanāskandha ātmīyagrāhaḥ /	tām ca ātmā saṃvedayate iti vedanā skandhaḥ ātmīya grāhaḥ 	And the self experiences that, so the feeling aggregate is grasped as what belongs to the self.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-27']	tatra śubhānāṃ karmaṇāṃ sukho 'nubhavo vipākaḥ /	tatra śubhānām karmaṇām sukhaḥ nubhavaḥ vipākaḥ 	There, the result of good actions is pleasant experience.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-28']	aśubhānāṃ karmaṇāṃ duḥkhaḥ /	aśubhānām karmaṇām duḥkhaḥ 	For unwholesome actions, it is suffering.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-29']	ubhayeṣām aduḥkhāsukhaḥ /	ubhayeṣām aduḥkha asukhaḥ 	For both, it is neither-suffering-nor-happiness.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-30']	atra cālayavijñānasamprayuktopekṣaiva paramārthataḥ karmavipākaḥ /	atra ca ālayavijñāna samprayuktā upekṣā eva paramārthataḥ karma vipākaḥ 	And here, only the equanimity associated with the ālaya-vijñāna is ultimately the ripening of karma.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-31']	śubhāśubhakarmavipākatvād ālayavijñānasya /	śubha aśubha karma vipāka tvāt ālayavijñānasya 	Because the ālaya-vijñāna is the ripening of wholesome and unwholesome actions.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-32']	sukhaduḥkhayos tu vipākajatvād vipākopacāraḥ /	sukha duḥkhayoḥ tu vipāka ja tvāt vipāka upacāraḥ 	But because happiness and suffering are born from that, they are figuratively called ripening.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-33']	dṛṣṭaśrutamatavijñāteṣv artheṣv ātmanaḥ sañjñādvāreṇa saṃvyavahāraḥ pravartata iti sañjñāskandha ātmīyagrāhaḥ /	dṛṣṭa śruta mata vijñāteṣu artheṣu ātmanaḥ sañjñā dvāreṇa saṃvyavahāraḥ pravartate iti sañjñā skandhaḥ ātmīya grāhaḥ 	In regard to objects seen, heard, cognized, and known, the usage of the self proceeds by way of the door of perception. Thus the aggregate of perception is the grasping of what belongs to the self.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-34']	kuśalākuśalādiṣu saṃskārair ātmābhimatasya cittasya preraṇātsaṃskāraskandha ātmīyagrāha iti p / pañcaiva skandhaḥ //	kuśala akuśala ādiṣu saṃskāraiḥ ātma abhimatasya cittasya preraṇāt saṃskāra skandhaḥ ātmīya grāhaḥ iti p pañca eva skandhaḥ 	Because the mind, which is regarded as the self, is impelled by formations in regard to what is wholesome, unwholesome, etc., the aggregate of formations is the grasping of what belongs to the self. Thus there are only five aggregates.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-35']	atha kasmāt skandhānām iyam evānupūrvī /	atha kasmāt skandhānām iyam eva ānupūrvī 	Now, why is there this very sequence of the aggregates?
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-36']	yathaudārikataḥ /	yathā audārikataḥ 	As it is in order of coarseness.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-37']	tatra sarvaudārikaṃ rūpaṃ sapratighatvāt pañcavijñānakāyāśrayatvāt ṣaḍvijñānaviṣayatvāt /	tatra sarva audārikam rūpam sa pratigha tvāt pañca vijñāna kāya āśraya tvāt ṣaṣ vijñāna viṣaya tvāt 	Among them, form is the coarsest, because it has resistance, because it is the basis of the five groups of consciousness, and because it is the object of the six consciousnesses.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-38']	ata ādāv audārikaṃ rūpam uktam /	atas ādau audārikam rūpam uktam 	Therefore, form is said to be the coarsest at the beginning.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-39']	tribhyaḥ pracāraudārikatayaudārikatarā vedanā /	tribhyaḥ vedanā 	Feeling is coarser than the three, because it is coarse in its manifestation.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-40']	tathā hy adeśasthām api sañjñādivat pracāraudārikatvād deśaparicchedena tām eva vyapadiśanti na sañjñādīn haste me vedanā śirasi me vedaneti	tathā hi adeśa sthām api sañjñā ādi vat pracāra audārika tvāt deśa paricchedena tām eva vyapadiśanti na sañjñā ādīn haste me vedanā śirasi me vedanā iti 	For they designate it by the delimitation of space, as if it were located in space, like perception, etc., because its occurrence is coarse, saying I have pain in my hand, I have pain in my head, not I have perception, I have feeling.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-41', 'SA_T06_pskvbhu-42']	ato rūpānantaram uktā /🔽dvābhyām audārikatarā sañjñānimittodgrahaṇātmakatvena sulakṣyatvāt /	atas rūpa anantaram uktā  dvābhyām audārikatarā sañjñā nimitta udgrahaṇa ātmaka tvena su lakṣya tvāt 	Therefore it is mentioned immediately after form.🔽Perception is coarser than consciousness by two [factors]. Because it is easy to discern, having the nature of grasping the sign of an object.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-43']	vijñānāt saṃskārā audārikatarāḥ saṃskaraṇalakṣaṇatvena sukhāvabodhatvāt /	vijñānāt saṃskārāḥ audārikatarāḥ saṃskaraṇa lakṣaṇa tvena sukha avabodha tvāt 	Formations are coarser than consciousness, because they are easily understood as having the characteristic of forming.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-44']	sarvaśūkṣmatvād vijñānaṃ sarvapaścād uktam //	sarva śūkṣma tvāt vijñānam sarva paścāt uktam 	Consciousness is mentioned last of all because it is the most subtle of all.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-45']	rūpaskandha iti samānādhikaraṇo vā syāt /	rūpa skandhaḥ iti samāna adhikaraṇaḥ vā syāt 	Form aggregate - this could be a co-referential compound,
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-46']	ṣaṣṭhītatpuruṣo vā /	ṣaṣṭhī tatpuruṣaḥ vā 	or a tatpurusa compound with the sixth case ending.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-47']	na bhavet samānādhikaraṇaḥ /	na bhavet samāna adhikaraṇaḥ 	It could not be a co-referential compound.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-48']	adravyatvāt skandhasya /	adravya tvāt skandhasya 	Because the aggregate is not a substance.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-49']	yasmāt skandhaśabdo rāśiparyāyavacanaḥ /	yasmāt skandha śabdaḥ rāśi paryāya vacanaḥ 	Because the word aggregate is a synonym for heap.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-50']	tasmād rāśivat prajñaptisantaḥ skandhā iti /	tasmāt rāśi vat prajñapti santaḥ skandhāḥ iti 	Therefore, the aggregates are nominally existent like a heap.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-51']	tataś ca sāmānādhikaraṇyābhāvaḥ /	tatas ca sāmānādhikaraṇya abhāvaḥ 	And from that, there is the absence of co-reference.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-52']	ṣaṣṭhītatpuruṣo 'pi na prāpnoti /	ṣaṣṭhī tatpuruṣaḥ pi na prāpnoti 	A tatpurusa compound with the sixth case ending is also not possible.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-53']	sambandho hi dvayoḥ parasparavibhinnarūpayor bhavati /	sambandhaḥ hi dvayoḥ paraspara vibhinna rūpayoḥ bhavati 	For a relation occurs between two things that have mutually distinct forms,
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-54']	devadattamātulavat /	devadatta mātula vat 	like Devadatta and his uncle.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-55']	sambandhārthā ceyaṃ ṣaṣṭhī rūpaskandhayor iti rūpād anya eva p / skandhaḥ prāpnoti /	sambandha arthā ca iyam ṣaṣṭhī rūpa skandhayoḥ iti rūpāt anyaḥ eva skandhaḥ prāpnoti 	And if this genitive has the meaning of relation, then the aggregate would be something other than form.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-56']	na caitad iṣyate /	na ca etat iṣyate 	But this is not accepted.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-57']	prajñaptisataḥ svopādānāt tattvānyatvenāvācyatvāt /	prajñapti sataḥ sva upādānāt tattva anya tvena avācya tvāt 	Because what is nominally existent is inexpressible as either the same as or different from its basis.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-58']	naiṣa doṣaḥ /	na eṣa doṣaḥ 	This is not a fault.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-59']	abhede 'pi ṣaṣṭhī dṛṣṭā tattvānyatvenāvācye ca pratimāyāḥ śarīram /	abhede pi ṣaṣṭhī dṛṣṭā tattva anyatvena avācye ca pratimāyāḥ śarīram 	The genitive is seen even when there is no difference, and in what is inexpressible as either the same as or different, as in the body of the image.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-60']	rūpasya prāgabhāva iti /	rūpasya prāgabhāvaḥ iti 	The prior non-existence of form.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-61']	na hi pratimā śarīrād anyā /	na hi pratimā śarīrāt anyā 	For the image is not different from the body.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-62']	prāgabhāvo 'pi nirūpākhyatvāt tattvānyatvenāvācyaḥ /	prāgabhāvaḥ pi nirūpa ākhya tvāt tattva anyatvena avācyaḥ 	And the prior non-existence, being without form, is inexpressible as either the same as or different.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-63']	svarūpanibandhanatvāt tattvānyatvayoḥ /	svarūpa nibandhana tvāt tattva anyatvayoḥ 	Because being the same or different is based on one's own nature.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-64']	anyavastugrahaṇāpekṣaṃ niḥsvabhāvatvād yatra grahaṇam abhidhānaṃ ca tad upādānavyatiriktasvabhāvābhāvāt prajñaptisat /	anya vastu grahaṇa apekṣam niḥsvabhāva tvāt yatra grahaṇam abhidhānam ca tat upādāna vyatirikta svabhāva abhāvāt prajñapti sat 	Because it depends on the apprehension of another thing, it is nominally existent, because it has no inherent nature. Where there is apprehension and designation, it does not have a nature separate from its basis.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-65']	tathaiva ca skandhārtha iti prajñaptisann ucyate /	tathā eva ca skandha arthaḥ iti prajñapti san ucyate 	And the meaning of aggregate is just like that. Therefore it is said to be nominally existent.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-66']	ataś ca tattvānyatvenāvācyatve 'pi svopādānāt ṣaṣṭhī na virudhyate /	atas ca tattva anyatvena avācya tve pi sva upādānāt ṣaṣṭhī na virudhyate 	And therefore, even though it is inexpressible as either the same as or different, the genitive is not contradicted because it is based on its own basis.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-67']	tataś ca ṣaṣṭhītatpuruṣa evātra //	tatas ca ṣaṣṭhī tatpuruṣaḥ eva atra 	And therefore, the compound is only a genitive tatpuruṣa here.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-68']	rūpaṃ katamat /	rūpam katamat 	What is form?
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-69']	catvāri mahābhūtāni catvāri ca mahābhūtāny upādāya /	catvāri mahābhūtāni catvāri ca mahābhūtāni upādāya 	The four great elements and that which is derived from the four great elements.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-70']	nanu ca skandhānāṃ prakṛtatvāt katamad rūpam ity asambaddhaḥ praśnaḥ /	nanu ca skandhānām prakṛta tvāt katamat rūpam iti asambaddhaḥ praśnaḥ 	But since the aggregates are the subject, the question What is form? is irrelevant.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-71']	nāsambaddhaḥ /	na asambaddhaḥ 	It is not irrelevant.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-72']	skandhānāṃ niḥsvabhāvatvāt tatsvabhāvavyapadeśena nirdhāraṇam aśakyam /	skandhānām niḥsvabhāva tvāt tad svabhāva vyapadeśena nirdhāraṇam aśakyam 	Because the aggregates have no intrinsic nature, it is impossible to determine them by designating their intrinsic nature.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-73']	kiṃ tarhi tadupādānanirdhāraṇenaiveti /	kim tarhi tad upādāna nirdhāraṇena evā iti 	Then what? By determining their material cause alone.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-74']	ato rūpaṃ katamad iti praśnaḥ /	atas rūpam katamat iti praśnaḥ 	Therefore, the question What is form?
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-75']	na rūpaskandha iti /	na rūpa skandhe iti 	Not the form aggregate.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-76']	rūpasya kāryakāraṇabhāvena bhedapradarśanārtham āha catvāri mahābhūtānītyādi /	rūpasya kārya kāraṇa bhāvena bheda pradarśana artham āha catvāri mahābhūtāni ityādi 	In order to show the difference of form by the relation of cause and effect, he says the four great elements and so on.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-77']	tathā hi sarvāṇi mahābhūtāni sarvasyopādāyarūpasya kāraṇam /	tathā hi sarvāṇi mahābhūtāni sarvasya upādāya rūpasya kāraṇam 	For indeed, all the great elements are the cause of all derivative form,

['SA_T06_pskvbhu-80']	athavā sarvarūpādisamudāyeṣu kāṭhinyādisadbhāvān mahāsanniveśatvād mahattvam /	athavā sarva rūpa ādi samudāyeṣu kāṭhinya ādi sadbhāvāt mahā sanniveśa tvāt mahat tvam 	Or else, greatness is due to their being a great collection, because hardness and so on exist in all collections of form and so on.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-81']	bhūtatvaṃ tu punar eṣāṃ vividhopādāyarūpanirvṛttau tais taiḥ prakārair bhavantīti bhūtāni /	bhūta tvam tu punar eṣām vividha upādāya rūpa nirvṛttau taiḥ taiḥ prakāraiḥ bhavanti iti bhūtāni 	But the elements are so called because they exist in various ways in the production of the various derivative forms.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-82']	sarvasattvakarmādhipatyād vānādau saṃsāre na kadācin nābhūvann iti bhūtāni /	sarva sattva karma ādhipatyāt vā anādau saṃsāre na kadācid na abhūvan iti bhūtāni 	Or, they are elements because they never were non-existent in beginningless samsara due to the dominance of the karma of all beings.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-83']	na cānyeṣāṃ bhūtatvaprasaṅgo mahiṣādivad rūḍhiśabdatvāt /	na ca anyeṣām bhūta tva prasaṅgaḥ mahiṣa ādi vat rūḍhi śabda tvāt 	And there is no possibility of other things being elements, because the term is established in the sense of a buffalo, etc.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-84']	tāni punaś catvāry eva na nyūnādhikāni /	tāni punar catvāri eva na nyūna adhikāni 	Moreover, there are only four of them, not fewer or more.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-85', 'SA_T06_pskvbhu-86']	asāmarthyāpārthakatvaprasaṅgāt /🔽bhautikasya hy avadhṛtisnehapācanavyūhanamātrakam eva kāryam /	asāmarthya apārthaka tva prasaṅgāt  bhautikasya hi avadhṛti sneha pācana vyūhana mātrakam eva kāryam 	Because it would lead to the absurdity of lack of efficacy and purposelessness.🔽For the function of the derivative form is merely support, cohesion, cooking, and expansion.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-87']	tasya caitāvadbhir eva parisamāptatvād anyasya ca karaṇīyasyābhāvāt /	tasya ca etāvadbhiḥ eva parisamāpta tvāt anyasya ca karaṇīyasya abhāvāt 	And since that is completed by just these [four elements], and there is no other function,
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-88']	catvāry eva bhūtāni /	catvāri eva bhūtāni 	there are only four elements.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-89']	nanu ca dhṛtyādivad avakāśam apy upādāyarūpasya kāryam /	nanu ca dhṛti ādi vat avakāśam api upādāya rūpasya kāryam 	But just as with support, etc., space also functions as the room for derivative form.
['SA_T06_pskvbhu-90']	tac cākāśena kriyata iti pṛthivyādivad ākāśasyāpi mahābhūtatvaprasaṅgaḥ /	tat ca ākāśena kriyate iti pṛthivī ādi vat ākāśasya api mahābhūta tva prasaṅgaḥ 	And that is done by space. Therefore, like earth, etc., space also would be a great element.
