The perception of existence is also perceived by the qualities of the eye etc. It is heard by the three. There, the nose is said to be inference. The establishment of the established is the cause. The inference is again established. What is produced from the opposite is what is given. What is similar to the existent is what is inferred. The existence of the separated is the six-fold. The six-fold is the inference of the object to be ascertained. By the reasonings excluding substance like sound etc., the inference is well-known. The statement of the self is itself inference for seeing. The possibility is inference itself. The absence is the cause of the non-appearance of the inferential mark. Thus, the eclipse of the sun is said to be like that. Here in this verse, the commentary is: The number of verses is twenty-five in the description of the non-falling of the axe. The six-fold is the twenty-fifth, the abode of the wind.

If that which is known by other means of knowledge such as perception etc. is not the object of the Vedas, then they would be restatements. And if they are restatements, then they would be doubtful like memory, because there is no need for them when there is doubt about what is already known. For this very reason, human testimony is also a means of knowledge. For that also does not become a means of knowledge by mere capability, but rather by conveying what is not already known. It is not a means of knowledge by mere origination, because it is disregarded even then. For the natural tendency of words is to denote their own meanings, and the natural tendency of meanings is to be connected with each other when there is expectancy etc. Therefore, just as in the Veda, the means of knowledge is not contradicted,

There is no certainty in this, because of the absence of any such rule. And what will be the usage? The understanding is of the relation as stated, otherwise the meaning of the word is not understood, like the word 'madhukara'. The definite meaning and the connected meaning are due to the difference of persons. Thus, because of being subject to the speaker's intention, the mutual relation of the word meanings is based on the requirement of action. In the Vedanta statements which have meaning as their cause, it will be in the future. If it is argued that the relation is based on the mutual requirement due to the remaining fitness of the word meanings denoted by the words in the form of a collection of words where there is no requirement by the action, it is not so. Where there is no requirement by the action, there also the relation is based on the mutual requirement of the word meanings denoted by the words. And thus even in 'the king gives wood etc.', the meaning of the sentence is understood.

Similarly, in the case of non-existence, the absence of sequence and simultaneity is cognized, from which the absence of existence is to be inferred. And there is no such thing as non-existence for you, like a ghost that is cognized as such but is contradicted by something else. It is argued that a pillar is not a ghost, so it may be non-existent. It is not so, because this contradiction is based on the previous non-occurrence of such a contradiction. The possibility of the perception of the object denoted by the word 'non-existent' is not known, because absence is of the nature of the existence of the perception of the counter-entity, and not of the mere non-existence of the object.

First, the two dyads do not have color, taste, smell, or touch as their inherent cause, because they are the cause of those qualities that arise in the effect. The capacity of the similar class of other qualities is due to the difference in the inherent cause. But the dimensions of the dyad are the cause of the tripartite atom. If the dimensions of the dyad were the cause of the tripartite atom, the tripartite atom would be atomic only, not large. They say that dimension arises only from a dimension of the same class. And there is largeness in the tripartite atom, because it is a substance and a part of a substance, like a pot etc. And an effect arises without a cause that is perceptible by the eye. In the case of effects that arise from similar dimensions, there is an excess of largeness in one. Therefore, the causality of number alone is assumed.

Thus, there is agreement in terms of the mere requirement of the pride of being a bride who has not been given away. And in that case, conceptual cognitions are not a means of valid knowledge due to grasping concomitance. Similarly, the inferential mark is not a means of valid knowledge because the oneness that is not grasped is grasped only by perception, and because it is already obtained by itself through another means of valid knowledge.

The difference between the two ascertained ones is imaginary. If inference were to operate even by the power of imagination, there would be no fault. Even for the two, being an object and impermanence, which are not ascertained as having the same nature, the cognition of the property of the subject is possible due to the possibility of identity. If it is argued that the identity of being an object with impermanence is not possible due to the absence of exclusion from the contrary, it is true that there is no identity in the meaning of the treatise. However, it does exist, supported by imagination. That itself is employed to support another meaning, which is the inference. And when there is the form of exclusion of the object, and when there is the form of identity, for whom there is the cognition of that, the fallacious reason is stated in the case of disagreement. Even after the refutation of that, inference operates due to the non-apprehension of non-apprehension. Therefore, it would operate due to the cognition of identity with the absence of the reason, or due to the cognition of that form, in the case of disagreement with one's own study.

And it is not to be recited that many limbs are prohibited. Thus there is no injunction. The cognition of its multiplicity is not inferential, because inference does not operate in the absence of perception. And when there is a prohibition of what is cognized by perception, the inference of the prohibition operates by the cessation of the perceived means of knowledge. Thus it is contradicted by that itself. How can there be removal of the object from the object? When the object is contradicted, how can there be the cognition of what is contradicted? What happens to the inference in that case? First, the perception whose object is not contradicted by the limbs teaches the existence of the eye etc. And when that is cognized, its non-existence is not cognized.

The mind is said to be non-tangible and formless, like space. When these two contradictory reasons - being active and non-tangible - come together, there is doubt regarding the mind's having form or being formless.

And doubt arises from seeing what is seen and what is not seen. The perceptibility along with incorporeality is seen in the self, just as it is seen in the mind. Similarly, the activity along with corporeality is seen in the atom. Therefore, just as perceptibility along with incorporeality is seen, the activity along with corporeality is also seen. Hence, doubt arises as to whether the mind is corporeal or incorporeal, because perceptibility is seen in both what is seen and what is not seen. Since perceptibility is seen in both what is seen and what is not seen, there is doubt. Just as doubt arises as to whether the mind is corporeal or incorporeal, so too doubt arises as to whether it is active or not, because perceptibility is seen in both what is seen and what is not seen. Therefore, it should be seen that the doubt Is the mind active or not? is unanswerable.
