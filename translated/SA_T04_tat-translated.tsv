Therefore, even the state of being a cause of the seed, etc., is not denied.

And that primordial matter is like the difference between a pot, etc., say the followers of Kapila.

Whatever reply you have to that, is the same for the wise ones also.

Therefore, the cause is not accepted, because it is not to be accomplished, like the other self.

Birth does not occur even from a restricted cause, nor is there power or action.
['SA_T04_tat-16']	sarvātmanā ca niṣpatterna kāryamiha kiṃcana / kāraṇavyapadeśo'pi tasmānnaivopapadyate //	sarva ātmanā ca niṣpatteḥ na kāryam iha kiṃcana kāraṇa vyapadeśaḥ upi tasmāt na eva upapadyate 	And because of complete accomplishment, there is no effect here at all. Therefore, even the designation of a cause is not logically possible.
['SA_T04_tat-17']	sarvaṃ ca sādhanaṃ vṛttaṃ viparyāsanivartakaṃ / niścayotpādakaṃ cedaṃ na tathā yuktisaṅgatam //	sarvam ca sādhanam vṛttam viparyāsa nivartakam niścaya utpādakam ca idam na tathā yukti saṅgatam 	And all the means of knowledge remove error and produce certainty, but this is not logically coherent in that way.

Nor is there production of certainty, because of that alone, everything is useless.

It is not the production of an excess of form, because of non-division and irrelevance.
['SA_T04_tat-21']	na tadviṣayasaṃvittirnopalambhāvṛtikṣayaḥ / nityatvādupalambhasya dvitīyasyāpyasaṃbhavāt //	na tad viṣaya saṃvittiḥ na upalambha āvṛti kṣayaḥ nitya tvāt upalambhasya dvitīyasya api asaṃbhavāt 	There is no cognition of that object, nor the destruction of the limiting adjunct. Because cognition is eternal, and because a second [cognition] is impossible.

Similarly, even though non-existence is the same, not everything is the cause of everything.

But when there is existence, is not the restriction of those [powers] proper without limits?🔽It is not so. Let there be no word in that way due to their non-establishment. There is no harm to the nature of the entity separated from all limiting adjuncts.

['SA_T04_tat-27']	yadidaṃ vastuno rūpamekānantaramīkṣyate / prāgāsīnneti tadbījaṃ prāgbhūte tvidamasti na //	yat idam vastunaḥ rūpam eka anantaram īkṣyate prāk āsīt na iti tat bījam prāk bhūte tu idam asti na 	This form of an entity that is seen immediately after, was not before. The seed of that [form] existed before, but this [form] did not exist before.

For, the existence of sattva is not the existence of rajas and tamas.
['SA_T04_tat-30']	satvādyanugataṃ vyaktaṃ na siddhaṃ naḥ kathaṃcana / āntaratvātsukhādīnāṃ vyaktatvāttatsvasaṃvidaḥ //	sattva ādi anugatam vyaktam na siddham naḥ kathaṃcana āntara tvāt sukha ādīnām vyakta tvāt tad sva saṃvidaḥ 	Manifestation as associated with sattva, etc. is not at all established for us, because pleasure, etc. are internal, and because their cognition is self-evident.

The atom, which is not perceived by the senses, is held to be of a different nature, on account of its not possessing these attributes.

Water, fire, etc. are not grasped by two sense organs, therefore, the substratum is not established, as the subject has been stated.🔽The distinctive arrangement, as in temples etc., even when the agent is not perceived, when seen, there is the cognition of an intelligent being.

The negative particle is not combined with words like 'ca' (and), etc., so there is no exclusion. And the exclusion of others in the meaning of a sentence cannot be indicated. And in the case of words like 'ananvyapoha' (non-exclusion of others), etc., the denoted object is not determined.

For there is nothing at all that is not all, of which there can be a denial. If it is said that 'one' and so on are not all, then the exclusion of meaning is implied. Because the parts are denied, and because the whole is not desired separately. In this way, in the meaning of the word 'collection', due to the exclusion of the components, and because of the undesirability of others, all of them become meaningless. And the words 'two' and so on that are accepted here as the domain of combination, would not become of that kind by the exclusion of 'one' and so on. And if the exclusion 'not non-cow' is said to be the meaning of the word 'cow', is it an existent or a non-existent? Is it a cow or even a non-cow? If it is a cow, then this dispute does not exist, but the meaning is characterized by affirmation. If a non-cow is denoted by the word 'cow', then there is skill in the meaning of the word beyond. This non-existence is also not proper, because of the impossibility of injunctions and so on. For no one understands non-existence from the word 'cow'.

Revelation also does not establish him; the other is not created, uncreated, or created. He himself is not a valid means of knowledge, so the created one does not enlighten him. The statement of Manu and others also has truth only created by that. But how can an unconnected, hateful, truthful speaker be? Therefore, even if the author of the Veda exists, he is not our means of knowing the Veda. If someone similar to the author of the Veda were seen now, then by that analogy, the author could also be analogized. If nothing established by valid knowledge would be established without the author of the Veda, then the author of the Veda would certainly be known by presumption.

Because it is only when the existence of a thing is well known that there can be any idea of its similarity; and the present argument is meant to prove the existence of the omniscient person. Thus, the existence of the omniscient person cannot be established by analogy.

If all men have been seen by you to be non-omniscient, then, on the basis of that, you yourself would be omniscient, because you have the vision of what is remote and hidden. And because you have the power of knowing the cognition related to the mental continuum of another person.🔽Even in regard to a person standing before you, how can you have the definite cognition that ‘this person is not omniscient’? In fact, you can have such a cognition only if you have the knowledge of what is beyond the senses.

Endowed with all aspects, teaching good conduct, bringing about various kinds of prosperity for the virtuous both in this world and the next, proclaiming the antidotes to the entire mass of latent tendencies, and breaking down the door of the city of nirvana - if that [Dharma] were the words of playful demons or Rakshasas, let them alone be the fully enlightened ones, as they possess all those characteristics. Indeed, the form of a thing is not negated by the mere creation of a different name. One may give a different name to a distinguished [person], but not to an undistinguished one.

It is suspected to be laid down by serpents, demons, etc. For such speech is possible in the case of those who delight in such actions.🔽The cognition of mutually contradictory things like purity and impurity etc., having different natures, is seen by a single cognition. For they are not contradictory to cognition.

The non-coexistence of two cognitions in one person is not contradiction among them. For the simultaneous perception by the eye of purity, impurity, fire, etc., which have mutually exclusive characteristics, is seen.

The differences of blue, yellow, white, etc., which are not contradictory to each other, are seen simultaneously in different places and different natures.

The omniscient one is thus established. Therefore, sequence is not accepted.🔽Whatever he wishes to know, he knows it by mere will. His power is of such a kind. He is one whose practice is perfected. He understands simultaneously or sequentially according to his will. And the Lord, having obtained knowledge, understands all things by moments such as the beginning. Or by sixteen minds, having the nature of the four truths, he understands all knowable things sequentially. Therefore, he is called the Omniscient One.
