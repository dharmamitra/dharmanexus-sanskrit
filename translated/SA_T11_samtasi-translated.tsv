The difference is made by the appearance as disconnected or non-disconnected, not by the difference in the cause of the trembling of the two cognitions. Therefore, even for those appearing as non-disconnected, there would be no cause, because there is no distinction. If that is so, the difference in appearance distinguished by non-disconnectedness is not preceded by trembling, but rather the appearance itself of the special action that is disconnected, such as the throwing of an arrow or a stone, the construction of a machine, or the movement of another. This is because the appearance of the special action that is disconnected, such as the throwing of an arrow or a stone, the construction of a machine, or the movement of another, is preceded by trembling. And because the movement, etc. caused by another, even though non-disconnected, is not preceded by that.

If any one of them were prior, none would be prior to it, because there would be no distinction. Therefore, the general particular action is the indicator of the general particular vibration. There, just as one infers vibration in another by perceiving action and not perceiving it in oneself, similarly, even in the perception of the appearance of action.

The knowledge of action and expression is the effect, and the mere general movement is the cause. The effect is known through the cause. The inward activity is caused by one's own movement, while the other is different. This distinction is made generally. That causal relation between the two is the same in the states of sleep, etc., and in the other states as well. In the state of delusion, the consciousness that arises from the movement of another, due to the specific conditions of each individual, sometimes obtains manifestation even from a distant enjoyment. But not from a completely non-existent enjoyment. Therefore, in all states, the movement of the mind is inferred from the manifestation of action, etc.

Let there be the appearance of the cognition, but not motion. Motion is inferred from the appearance of motion. For those in an erroneous state, there is no motion at all, because of the arising of cognition devoid of an object. There is no fault, because of the similarity of all types of designation. Sometimes cognition is devoid of an object, and at other times it is otherwise - from where is this authority obtained? If it is argued that the absence of motion is due to the state of sleep, etc., if that were possible, let it be so. The arising is like that due to being overwhelmed by ignorance. If that is so, then by abandoning the doctrine of external objects, these many faults that cannot be concealed are destroyed by the following [verse].

However, the appearances of intimation connected with another continuum cannot be the other's intimation. If it is argued that this is because they are not what is taken up and what takes up, it is not so. It is not said that the mind that gives rise to them is understood by the appearance in the consciousness because it arises from the other's mind. What then? Because it is their effect. Intimation is only the consciousnesses that have the form of action and speech, which arise from the continuum of the mind that gives rise to them. And the mind that gives rise to them is the material cause of those two. But for the consciousnesses of another continuum, it is the dominant condition. They are produced from the intimation that is taken up. They are called intimation figuratively because of their connection with that.

Or does it not? If it objectifies, it would be a different object. But if it is not an object, how is the existence of another's mind cognized by the cognition? If it is argued that it is impossible without knowing its own nature, that is also equally applicable. Even for those who cognize another's mind through action and speech, if the form of that [mind] is objectified, the cognition of its aspect would also be entailed, like the knowledge of one's own mind.

The validity of that prior cognition cannot be established merely by that, because at that time all cognitions are false. In that case, the cognition of representation never arises without the influence of mental movement. Therefore, it is inferred from those two. Sometimes, due to the influence of error, it arises even when obstructed, but it is not devoid of the influence of those two. The difference is that it arises directly and indirectly, as stated. There, just as the prior cognitions of representation arise indirectly through the influence of movement, so do those that occur in subsequent states. The arising is only from the continuum of mind in the subsequent state of the movement that is the basis of the cognition of representation. Even there, the inference is of that kind, and the usage of non-deception is also present, but it is not grasped by anyone.

But how about those who directly know the mind of another? If they directly know the nature of the mind of another, then there would be the grasping of something else. But if they do not know, how are they direct knowers? How can there be non-grasping of the nature of an object by direct perception? But if it is not grasped, then how is it a valid means of knowledge? Even the knowledge of the mind of another of yogis who have not eliminated the discrimination of grasped and grasper is a valid means of knowledge in terms of the conventional due to non-deception, just like the seeing of form and so on. Because the basis has not been transformed. For their knowledge arises clearly, imitating the specific aspects of the mind of another, by the power of yoga. Like the seeing of true dreams by the power of karma, gods, and so on. Even for them, knowledge does not arise with the mind of another as its object. They also know only the appearance of their own mind similar to that form.
