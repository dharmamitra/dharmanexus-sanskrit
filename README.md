This repository hosts the data that is the backbone for the Dharmamitra Search and Dharmanexus intertextuality system. 

Sanskrit data is currently sourced via:  
GRETIL (https://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil.html)  
Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon (https://www.dsbcproject.org/)  
Muktabodha (https://muktabodha.org/)  
We also conduct ongoing efforts of collection and digitization of Sanskrit material within the Dharmamitra project to expand the coverage in our search and intertextuality systems.
