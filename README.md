This repository hosts the data that is the backbone for the Dharmamitra Search and Dharmanexus intertextuality system. 
We are currently working on a detailed metadata catalog that will give original source attribution for each text. It is currently under review and will be uploaded here in autumn 2025.  
Sanskrit data is currently sourced via:  
GRETIL (https://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil.html)  
Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon (https://www.dsbcproject.org/)  
Muktabodha (https://muktabodha.org/)  
We also conduct ongoing efforts of collection and digitization of Sanskrit material within the Dharmamitra project to expand the coverage in our search and intertextuality systems.
